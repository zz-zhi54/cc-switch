## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Codex `[memories]` Switch Crash on Custom Models**: When the active Codex provider's model is not exposed by the previously pinned `extract_model` / `consolidation_model` (e.g. user has `[memories] extract_model = "MiniMax-M3"` in `config.toml` and switches to a custom provider with `model = "deepseek-v4-pro"`), Codex's memory/chronicle backend errors because the model is unreachable. The Codex form now exposes a new 「启用 Codex 记忆功能」 checkbox in the `config.toml` editor row (between 「启用远程压缩」 and 「写入通用配置」). When checked, cc-switch writes the active `model` into both fields on every save/switch; when unchecked, the entire `[memories]` table is removed. Other `[memories]` keys (`generate_memories` / `use_memories` / `disable_on_external_context` / `min_rate_limit_remaining_percent`) are preserved untouched. See <https://developers.openai.com/codex/memories> for the field semantics.

## [3.16.4] - 2026-06-27

Development since v3.16.3 focuses on tightening the Codex proxy path — native OpenAI Responses migration for the major Chinese providers, a decoupled upstream-format selector, zstd request/error-body decompression, and a run of tool-call and OAuth-over-proxy fixes — alongside richer usage and pricing tooling (models.dev pricing import, Volcengine Ark coding/agent-plan quotas, live-tracking date ranges, GLM-5.2/Doubao Seed 2.1 pricing), new proxy and resilience capabilities (custom request header/body overrides, an in-app recovery screen for too-new databases, native Windows ARM64 builds), and a broad wave of preset and branding updates (the SubRouter and OpenCode Go subscriptions, the CTok→ETok rename, Kimi rebranding and prime-partner badges, and a Kimi K2.7 Code sponsor banner).

**Stats**: 53 commits | 126 files changed | +8,149 insertions | -1,016 deletions

### Added

- **In-App Recovery Screen for a Too-New Database**: When the SQLite `user_version` is newer than the app supports (`SCHEMA_VERSION`) — e.g. after a downgrade or because a third-party client wrote the file — startup used to dead-end in a native Retry/Exit dialog where Retry just failed again. The app now boots a dedicated recovery screen offering an in-place "Upgrade app" button (download + install + restart with a progress bar) when an update is available, or a warning that even the latest build can't read the database when none is. The too-new check runs before any schema writes so the app never runs DDL against a database it can't understand, and native-close quits cleanly in recovery mode where no tray exists. (#4575)
- **Local Proxy Request Overrides (Custom Headers and Body)**: Provider configs can now define custom request headers and request-body overrides that the local proxy applies when forwarding, exposed via a new field in the Claude and Codex provider forms. Inputs are validated, including a protected-header-name list that blocks overriding security-sensitive headers. (#4589)
- **Volcengine Ark Coding/Agent Plan Usage Query**: Usage panels can now query coding-plan and agent-plan quota for Volcengine Ark. Because the Ark control-plane OpenAPI (`open.volcengineapi.com`) requires account-level AccessKey signing rather than the inference API key, the usage script gains a dedicated AK/SK input block, with a clickable link straight to the Volcengine IAM key-management console (`https://console.volcengine.com/iam/keymanage`), and the proxy implements Volcengine Signature V4 (an AWS SigV4 variant with fixed canonical header order, `HMAC-SHA256` algorithm, and `ark` service scope). It auto-detects the plan by probing `GetAFPUsage` (Agent Plan five-hour/weekly/monthly quotas) before falling back to `GetCodingPlanUsage`, parses the window label from the `Level` field (guarding `ResetTimestamp <= 0`), and adds a `monthly` tier label across the footer, tray menu, and all four locales.
- **Import Model Pricing from models.dev**: The Add Pricing panel gains an "Import from models.dev" button that fetches `https://models.dev/api.json`, lets users full-text search the catalog, and imports the selected entry through the same `update_model_pricing` path as manual entry. Imported model IDs are normalized to match the backend's `clean_model_id_for_pricing` rules (strip vendor prefix, lowercase, drop `:` suffix, map `@` to `-`, drop the `[1m]` marker) so stored rows actually match cost-attribution lookups. A companion fix makes the scoped zero-cost backfill match raw model aliases (route prefixes, `:free` variants, date suffixes) in Rust instead of by exact SQL string, so newly priced alias rows get costed immediately rather than waiting for the next startup backfill (Fixes #4017). (#4079)
- **Windows ARM64 Release Builds**: Releases now include native Windows ARM64 artifacts so ARM-based Windows devices get a matching build instead of relying on x64 emulation. The release matrix also runs each platform independently (fail-fast disabled) so a missing-secret failure on one job — e.g. macOS signing in forks — no longer cancels its siblings before they finish. (#3950)
- **Live End Time for Custom Date Ranges**: The custom date-range picker gains an "End time follows current time" checkbox; when enabled the end time becomes read-only and tracks the current moment, so usage data always reflects up-to-the-second consumption from the chosen start. This is especially useful for watching real-time token use within a Coding Plan 5-hour quota window. `liveEndTime` is included in the React Query cache keys so a live range and a fixed range with the same stored endpoints no longer collide on a stale cache entry. (#4438)
- **Source File Name in Session Detail Header**: The session detail header now shows the session log's file name (with the full path on hover and click-to-copy) alongside the project directory, so users can locate and open the underlying JSONL file directly from the UI. Long, space-less basenames such as ~70-char Codex rollout files are truncated at `max-w-[200px]` to keep them from overflowing into the action-button area on narrow windows. (#4113)
- **Unmanaged-Skill Indicator on Import Button**: The top-bar Skills Import button now shows a green dot with a tooltip when local unmanaged skills are available to import, so you can tell at a glance that on-disk skills aren't tracked yet. The scan runs once on mount and is shared across navigations (30s `staleTime` + `keepPreviousData`) to avoid repeated disk IO.
- **OpenCode Go Subscription Presets**: New OpenCode Go (`opencode.ai/zen/go`) presets for Claude, Codex, and OpenCode, authenticated with a plain pasteable API key (no OAuth). The Codex preset uses `openai_chat` conversion with a GLM/Kimi/DeepSeek/MiMo model catalog (and no static `codexChatReasoning`, so per-model capability is inferred), while OpenCode targets `/zen/go/v1` via `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible`. All four OpenCode Go presets — Claude, Claude Desktop, Codex, and OpenCode — carry a referral link and an in-app promo phrase; the promo banner is now gated on `partnerPromotionKey` alone rather than `isPartner`, so a preset can show a referral promo without earning the gold paid-partner star (this also re-surfaces the existing MiniMax promos).
- **SubRouter Partner Provider**: Added SubRouter (`subrouter.ai`), an AI relay aggregator that exposes many models and providers behind a single key, as a preset across all seven managed apps — the Anthropic-format endpoint for Claude Code / Claude Desktop / OpenClaw / Hermes, the OpenAI-compatible `/v1` endpoint with `gpt-5.5` for Codex and OpenCode, and the Gemini-compatible `/v1beta` endpoint with `gemini-3.5-flash` for Gemini CLI — carrying its own brand icon, the gold partner star, four-locale promotion copy, and the affiliate registration link (`?aff=l3ri`) prefilled as the API-key signup URL. (#4522)
- **Prime-Partner Preset Badge and Ordering**: First-party Moonshot Kimi presets (Kimi / Kimi For Coding / Kimi K2.7 Code) are now flagged as prime partners: instead of the gold star, they render a solid gold heart with no badge frame, and in the default (Original) sort they float to the top right after official-category presets, ahead of the rest. Grouping is a three-way partition so each group keeps its internal order and an official preset also flagged prime-partner stays only in the official group.
- **Pricing for GLM-5.2 and Doubao Seed 2.1**: Seed model pricing now includes GLM-5.2 (#4385) and Doubao Seed 2.1 Pro/Turbo, so usage from these models is cost-attributed correctly instead of recording zero cost. Doubao prices use Volcengine's official list price (CNY converted at ~7.14); `cache_creation` is kept at 0 because Doubao bills cache storage by time rather than per-token writes, and the existing 2.0 rows are retained for historical accounting.
- **Kimi For Coding Auto-Compact Window**: The Kimi For Coding preset now sets `CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW` to a default of 262144 to match the official Kimi docs, exposed via `templateValues` so users can customize the value for future models or performance tuning. (#4401)

### Changed

- **Native Responses API for CN Codex Providers**: Several Chinese providers (Qwen/DashScope Bailian, Xiaomi MiMo, Volcengine Doubao, Meituan LongCat, MiniMax CN/intl) now expose a native OpenAI Responses endpoint, so their Codex presets switch to `apiFormat: "openai_responses"` and reach the upstream directly instead of going through the Responses->Chat route-takeover conversion. Dropping the now-unused `codexChatReasoning` and `modelCatalog` also keeps the "local route mapping" toggle unchecked by default. SiliconFlow-hosted MiniMax stays `openai_chat` since it is a third-party endpoint rather than MiniMax's own base_url. Stale model ids on the remaining chat-only providers were refreshed as well (GLM 5.1->5.2, StepFun 3.5-flash-2603->3.7-flash, Ling 2.5-1T->2.6-1T).
- **Decoupled Upstream Format Selector from Model-Mapping Toggle**: The Codex provider form used to tie Chat-format conversion and route takeover (model mapping) to a single toggle, so a provider serving a native Responses API could not use model mapping without forcing Chat Completions conversion. The upstream format (Chat Completions / Responses) is now an independent, always-visible selector, while the local-routing toggle solely gates the advanced sub-sections (model mapping catalog, plus reasoning capability when the format is Chat). Its initial state is derived from saved catalog presence with no new persisted field, and the `codexConfig` i18n strings were reworded across all four locales (zh/en/ja/zh-TW).
- **Doubao Seed 2.1 Pro Preset**: The DouBaoSeed preset now targets `doubao-seed-2-1-pro` (replacing `doubao-seed-2-0-code-preview-latest`) across all six clients (claude, claude-desktop, codex, opencode, openclaw, hermes), with display names updated to "Doubao Seed 2.1 Pro" and the OpenClaw cost field corrected from 0.002/0.006 to 0.84/4.2 USD per 1M tokens to match the new model.
- **CTok Rebranded to ETok**: Following the vendor's domain, endpoint, and trademark rename, all user-facing branding moves from CTok to ETok (`ctok.ai` -> `etok.ai`, `api.ctok.ai` -> `api.etok.ai`, internal id, display name, icons, and README partner banners) across every client preset. The Codex history-migration whitelist keeps `ctok` as a legacy id alongside the new `etok` so existing users' local session history stays correctly bucketed after the rename.
- **Consistent Kimi Preset Naming**: The OpenCode and OpenClaw Kimi presets, previously labeled "Kimi K2.7 Code", are renamed to plain "Kimi" (along with the OpenCode provider display name) to match the other apps; the model label stays "Kimi K2.7 Code" since it describes the actual model.
- **Dark Mode for JSON Editors**: The CodeMirror `JsonEditor` in the usage-script modal, provider form, and universal provider form now follows the app theme via `useDarkMode()`, switching to the `oneDark` editor theme instead of staying light while the rest of the app is dark. (#4556)
- **Tighter Add Provider Header With Footer Hint**: The Add Provider dialog reduces the title-to-tabs and tabs-to-card vertical gaps from 24px to 12px and adds an always-visible pinned footer hint guiding users to fill in the fields below after choosing a preset. `FullScreenPanel` gains an optional `contentClassName` prop so the padding override is scoped to this panel without affecting others that share it.
- **Theme-Adaptive Kimi Logo**: The inline Kimi placeholder mark is replaced with the vendor's refreshed logo. The K glyph uses `currentColor` so it follows the theme text color (dark in light mode, white in dark mode), while the brand accent dot is pinned to the new `#1783FF`, with the metadata fallback color aligned accordingly.
- **Fable 5 Verified Banner Removed**: The Settings About page no longer shows the Fable 5 Verified commemorative banner that 3.16.3 added beside the app name to mark the special build; the banner image and its markup are dropped, returning the About panel to its standard version-badge layout.

### Fixed

- **Copilot/Codex OAuth Requests Now Honor the Global Proxy**: `CopilotAuthManager` and `CodexOAuthManager` hardcoded `Client::new()` at construction, so their auth flows (token exchange, `/models` listing, model-vendor checks, device-code and OAuth-refresh requests) ignored the configured global proxy and connected directly. With Copilot the direct connection returned zero Claude models, breaking live model resolution and causing the upstream to reject requests with `400 model_not_supported`. Both managers now fetch the shared client per request via `crate::proxy::http_client::get()`, so they follow the global proxy URL and pick up runtime proxy changes. Fixes #2016, #2931. (#4583)
- **Compressed Request and Error Body Decompression**: Codex Desktop sends zstd-compressed request bodies when authenticated against the Codex backend, which broke local proxy routing because the handlers parsed the raw compressed bytes with `serde_json` directly. The proxy now decompresses request bodies (gzip/br/deflate plus new zstd support, including stacked codings like `gzip, zstd`) before JSON parsing across the three Codex handlers and strips the stale `content-encoding`/`content-length`/`transfer-encoding` headers so the forwarder regenerates them. Upstream non-2xx error bodies are decompressed the same way, so compressed rate-limit and auth details are no longer dropped and hidden from the client. Fixes #3764, #3696. (#3817)
- **DeepSeek Endpoint `thinking: disabled` 400 Errors**: DeepSeek's Anthropic-compatible endpoint rejects requests where `thinking.type=disabled` coexists with effort parameters, returning HTTP 400, which broke Claude Code 2.1.166+ sub-agents (Workflow/Dynamic Workflow) that hardcode `thinking: disabled`. Rather than overriding the client's intent, the proxy now strips the conflicting `output_config.effort` / `reasoning_effort` parameters for the official DeepSeek endpoint, since sub-agents don't need to display reasoning. (#4239)
- **Reverted Anthropic System-Message Hoisting**: Reverts #3775's hoisting of `role=system` messages out of `messages[]` into the top-level `system` field for Anthropic-compatible providers. DeepSeek's endpoint accepts inline system messages natively, and the rewrite altered the request prefix; leaving the messages in place preserves the prompt prefix and avoids a suspected cache hit-rate regression (refs #4297). The unrelated Windows test fixes and the tool-thinking-history normalization from #3775 are kept. (#3775)
- **Chat Tool Calls with Missing Function Names**: Some upstreams send empty or absent function names in streaming tool-call deltas, which previously produced invalid Codex Chat output items (or an `unknown_tool` fallback). Accumulated tool-call state is no longer overwritten by empty deltas, and tool calls that never receive both a `call_id` and a valid name are skipped at finalization across the streaming, non-streaming, and legacy `function_call` paths. (#4159)
- **Restored Cached Codex Tool Call Fields**: When Codex sends a follow-up Chat request referencing `previous_response_id`, its `function_call` items can arrive carrying only `call_id`. The history enrichment previously refilled only `reasoning`/`reasoning_content`, leaving the function `name`, `arguments`, `status`, and related fields empty; it now restores all cached tool-call fields from history so the call is reconstructed correctly for the Chat upstream. (#4160)
- **Duplicate Codex base_url Entries in config.toml**: Writing the Codex `base_url` into `config.toml` only replaced or removed a single matching assignment per section, so a section that already contained multiple `base_url` lines kept the extras and accumulated duplicates. `setCodexBaseUrl` now collapses all matches in the target section or top level (replacing the first and removing the rest), and the TOML `base_url` regex handles escaped quotes. (#4316)
- **CODEX_SQLITE_HOME State DB Probing for History Migration**: The Codex session-history migration only scanned `~/.codex/state_5.sqlite` and the `config.toml` `sqlite_home` location, so when Codex's SQLite state was relocated via the `CODEX_SQLITE_HOME` env var the state DB was never scanned and its threads kept their old provider bucket. The shared `codex_state_db_paths` helper used by both the third-party and unified-session migrations now falls back to `CODEX_SQLITE_HOME` (config `sqlite_home` still takes precedence).
- **Provider Terminals Respect the User's Shell**: Launching a provider terminal on macOS/Linux hardcoded `bash`, so zsh/fish users' rc files never loaded. The launchers now detect the user's default shell from `$SHELL` (falling back to `/bin/zsh` on macOS, `/bin/bash` on Linux) and exec into it with clean-start flags, while the launch scripts themselves run through POSIX `sh` for portability (e.g. fish, NixOS where `/bin/sh` may not exist). (#4140, fixes #1546)
- **Claude MCP Path Honors Custom Config Dir**: When a custom Claude config directory is configured, MCP server reads and writes now resolve to that directory's MCP file instead of the default location, keeping MCP state isolated per profile. The previous copy-on-access migration of the legacy file was removed in favor of resolving the override path directly. (#3431)
- **Preset Search Results Clickable After Searching**: After searching in the Add Provider preset selector, results could no longer be clicked or selected. The `requestAnimationFrame` `select()` that raced with typing (and ate the first character, e.g. "gateway" -> "ateway") is removed, input autofocus is restored for the open-by-click path, and refocus is wired up for the Ctrl/Cmd+F shortcut while the box is open. The provider-list typing guard is also scoped to the Ctrl/Cmd+F branch so Escape still closes the search panel. (#4315)
- **Skills Browser and Provider Card Display Fixes**: Fixed several display and interaction issues: the repo-manager action stays available while browsing skills.sh and Refresh stays available even when a repo returns no results; long provider names and website URLs on the provider card now truncate instead of overflowing; the OMO model-variant dropdown truncates its selected label with a full-text tooltip; and Select menu items show a checkmark on the active option. (#4323)
- **Settings Scroll Resets on Tab Switch**: Switching tabs in the Settings dialog kept the previous tab's scroll position, sometimes landing partway down the new tab; the scroll container now resets to the top whenever the active tab changes. (#4165)

### Docs

- **Kimi Pinned Sponsor Banner**: The pinned sponsor banner at the top of all four README locales (en/zh/ja/de) now features Kimi K2.7 Code in place of the previous MiniMax M2.7 banner. The copy reflects the K2.7 Code release (a coding-focused agentic model that reduces thinking-token usage roughly 30% versus K2.6), the banner is served from in-repo assets (`assets/partners/banners/kimi-banner-en.png` / `kimi-banner-zh.png`) instead of the Moonshot CDN, and a clickable call-to-action links to the `aff=cc-switch` Moonshot console.
- **Codex Unified Session-History Guide**: New trilingual (zh/en/ja) guide for the unified Codex session-history toggle, explaining what opt-in migration (on enable) and ledger-based restore (on disable) actually do, why session data is never truly deleted (tag-only rewrite plus automatic backups), and how to verify files on disk versus merely being filed under another provider drawer. It includes a symptom reference table for the common "my sessions are gone" misunderstanding plus on-disk verification commands for macOS/Linux/Windows, and is linked as the lead item in the v3.16.3 "Usage Guides" release notes.
- **Simplified Homebrew Install Instructions**: The installation guide no longer instructs users to run `brew tap farion1231/ccswitch` before `brew install --cask cc-switch`; the deprecated tap step was removed from the en/ja/zh user manuals so the cask installs directly. (#4319)
- **Star-History Global Rank Badge**: Added a star-history global rank badge next to the existing Trendshift badge in all four README locales, with light/dark theme variants.
- **Volcengine Coding Plan Campaign Link**: The "中国大陆地区的开发者请点击这里" link in the ByteDance/Volcengine sponsor entry now points to the Volcengine `ai618` campaign page instead of the previous `codingplan` referral URL, updated across all four README locales.
- **CCSub Sponsor Banner Vector Asset**: Replaced the low-res `ccsub.jpg` sponsor logo with a vector `ccsub.svg`, letterboxed from 2046x648 to 2046x850 (~2.406:1) so it matches the other sponsor-table banners and renders at the same 62px height. All four README locales point at the new asset.

## [3.16.3] - 2026-06-14

Development since v3.16.2 focuses on getting usage accounting right end-to-end — billing route-takeover and format-conversion traffic by the real upstream model and pricing basis (schema v11), counting Claude Code Workflow sub-agent sessions, folding Claude Desktop into the Claude view, refreshing the model pricing seed, and reworking the usage dashboard with global provider/model filters, brand-icon toolbars, and far more resilient quota queries — while hardening the proxy (mislabeled SSE bodies, Codex image rectification, OAuth token and takeover-residue recovery, Hermes duplicate YAML keys), reworking provider configuration (a custom User-Agent override, a unified Codex advanced section, searchable preset selection, a Fable 5 tier, and refreshed Kimi/Unity2/Volcengine/MiniMax presets), and smoothing the update, About-panel, and provider-health experiences.

**Stats**: 59 commits | 130 files changed | +10,223 insertions | -4,232 deletions

### Added

- **Custom User-Agent Override**: Provider configs can now set a custom User-Agent that the proxy applies consistently across request forwarding, stream check, and model listing (`GET /v1/models`), so coding-plan upstreams that gate on UA no longer fail detection or return 403 while the proxy itself works. The Claude and Codex forms expose it in advanced settings with a curated presets dropdown (Claude Code / Kilo Code families that pass UA whitelists) and live non-blocking validation; stale custom UAs are dropped when switching to an official preset to avoid silently altering headers (#3671).
- **Unified Codex Session History**: Official Codex sessions can now share a single resume-history bucket with cc-switch third-party sessions via an opt-in toggle under Settings → Codex App Enhancements, so the resume picker no longer hides them from each other. When enabled, the live `config.toml` routes official runs through a shared `custom` model_provider that mirrors the built-in OpenAI provider (`auth.json` is untouched); the toggle is forward-only by default but the enable dialog offers a checkbox to migrate existing official sessions (with per-generation backups), and the disable dialog offers a precise ledger-based restore that only reverts sessions originally recorded as `openai` while leaving sessions created during the toggle untouched.
- **Dashboard-Wide Provider/Model Filters**: The provider and model filters move from inside the request-log table up to the top bar, applying globally to the hero summary, trend chart, request logs, and both stats tabs so you can scope the whole dashboard to a given source and model. Sources match by exact display name (so session placeholder rows like "Claude (Session)" are selectable) and models match by effective pricing model, with the model dropdown cascading from the selected source and both lists showing only options that have data in the current range.
- **Refreshed Model Pricing Seed**: Added pricing for 9 models including Claude Fable 5, Grok 4.3, Mistral Medium 3.5 / Small 4, and Qwen 3.7 Max/Plus, and corrected 28 existing prices against current official vendor list pricing (GLM, Grok, MiMo, Doubao, Kimi, MiniMax, Mistral, Qwen) so usage cost estimates are accurate. Each change updates the seed for fresh installs and adds a guarded repair for existing databases without clobbering user-edited rows.
- **Claude Fable 5 Model Tier**: Provider forms now expose `claude-fable-5` as a fourth model-mapping tier on both the Claude Code and Claude Desktop proxy paths, with a fable → opus → default fallback mirroring the official downgrade and the `fable-` prefix whitelisted for the Desktop 1.12603.1+ validator. A clarified four-language fallback hint warns that leaving a tier blank on third-party endpoints forwards the literal model name and 404s (#3980, #4026, #4049).
- **Unity2.ai Partner Provider**: Added Unity2.ai, an AI API relay partner, as a preset across all seven managed apps (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, OpenClaw, Claude Desktop, Hermes), each carrying the referral signup link and partner promotion copy in all four locales. Codex uses the bare base URL (the gateway exposes `/responses` at root) while OpenCode / OpenClaw / Hermes use the `/v1` chat-completions endpoint with `gpt-5.5`.
- **Kimi K2.7 Code Model**: Added the `kimi-k2.7-code` model (in $0.95 / out $4.00 / cache-read $0.19 per 1M tokens, 256K context) and pointed all six official Moonshot Kimi presets (Claude Code, Codex, Claude Desktop, Hermes, OpenCode, OpenClaw) at it, renaming the OpenCode / OpenClaw presets to "Kimi K2.7 Code". The pricing seed applies on startup via the idempotent insert path, so existing users pick up the new pricing without a migration.
- **Codex "Kimi For Coding" Preset Restored**: Re-added the Codex "Kimi For Coding" preset (`openai_chat`, `kimi-for-coding`, 256K context) with thinking mode enabled by default; it was previously removed because the coding endpoint rejects Codex's default `codex-cli` User-Agent with 403. It now works via proxy takeover combined with the custom User-Agent override (set to a whitelisted UA such as `claude-cli/*`).
- **Pricing-Model Audit in Request Detail**: The request detail panel now shows the requested model and the pricing model when they differ from the response model, making route-takeover bills auditable directly from the usage UI.
- **Preset Provider Search & Sorting**: The provider preset selector gains a searchable, sorted list with an inline search box (toggled via a magnifier icon, dismissed on ESC or outside click). Buttons use a responsive grid with consistent sizing and default icons, and search matches only provider display/raw names so URL fragments and shared category labels no longer produce noisy matches (#3975, #4183).
- **Claude Mythos 5 Pricing**: Registered the `claude-mythos-5` model in the bundled model/pricing table (in $10 / out $50 per 1M tokens, cache read $1.00, cache write $12.50), so usage metering prices and displays it correctly (#4077).
- **Fable 5 Verified Banner**: The Settings About page now displays a Fable 5 Verified banner beside the app name and version, marking this as a special build, with the version badge centered under the app name.

### Changed

- **Claude Desktop Usage Folded Into Claude**: The dashboard no longer shows a standalone "Claude Desktop" bucket, which only ever displayed a partial number (Desktop chat usage never passes through the proxy and its Code-tab sessions write into the shared `~/.claude/projects` tree). Desktop proxy traffic is now folded into the `claude` view for display while still recorded under its own `app_type` for route-takeover billing audit, with the real value visible in the request detail panel.
- **Lightweight Provider Health Check**: The provider health check no longer sends a real streaming model request (which many third-party providers blocked with 401/403/WAF, causing false negatives); it now performs a lightweight HTTP reachability probe of the provider `base_url`, treating any HTTP response as reachable and counting only DNS/connect/TLS/timeout as failure. The connectivity button is hidden for official providers (which use OAuth with an empty base URL and no reliable reachability target), the real-request confirmation dialog and test model/prompt fields are removed, and the degraded-latency threshold is set to 6s with an 8s timeout. The reachability check never resets the circuit breaker, so failover detection stays driven solely by real proxy traffic.
- **Codex Advanced Options Section**: The Codex provider form now folds local routing, model mapping, reasoning overrides, and custom User-Agent into a single collapsible advanced section mirroring the Claude form (auto-expanding when a UA is set or local routing is on). Custom User-Agent is now also configurable for native Responses providers, where it was previously reachable only with `openai_chat` routing enabled.
- **Usage Toolbar Refresh and Layout**: The app filter now renders brand icons (via ProviderIcon, with a grid icon for "All") instead of text tabs that wrapped awkwardly in narrow windows, and the usage hero shows the selected app's brand icon with Codex recolored to a neutral gray matching OpenAI's monochrome branding. The click-to-cycle refresh button becomes a Select with a localized "off" label, and the top-bar controls are compacted and aligned into consistent width groups with truncated long date-range labels.
- **Faster About Panel Loading**: The Settings About panel now loads progressively: the app version badge appears the instant it resolves instead of waiting for tool probes, each tool card updates the moment its own version check finishes (probes run concurrently rather than sequentially), and results are cached for the app session with a 10-minute TTL so reopening the About tab reuses cached values and revalidates stale ones in the background instead of re-probing all six tools every time.
- **Volcengine Ark Coding Plan Promo**: Updated the Volcengine Ark preset across all six apps with the new Coding Plan invite link (replacing the old Agent Plan / activity links) and refreshed the partner promotion copy in all four locales (two-month 75% off plus invite code 6J6FV5N2), correcting the product name from Agent Plan to Coding Plan.
- **MiniMax Demoted to Regular Provider**: Removed the gold partner star badge and the API-key promotion banner for MiniMax by dropping the `isPartner` flag from all its presets; it stays as a regular `cn_official` provider keeping its icon and theme. The promotion copy is kept dormant so the partnership can be re-enabled with a single line.
- **LemonData Removed, SudoCode Demoted**: Removed the LemonData provider preset entirely from all apps along with its promotion copy, icons, and sponsor listings, and demoted SudoCode from a partner to a regular `third_party` provider by dropping its `isPartner` flag and promotion copy (it keeps its icon).
- **AtlasCloud Codex GLM 5.1 Context Window**: Declared the 200,000-token context window for the `zai-org/glm-5.1` model in the AtlasCloud Codex preset, matching the other GLM 5.1 preset entries.

### Fixed

- **Route-Takeover Traffic Billed by the Real Upstream Model**: When a request was routed to a different upstream (env model mapping, Claude Desktop routes, Copilot normalization, Codex chat override), the proxy used to attribute and price usage by whatever model the upstream echoed back, recording kimi/glm tokens as `claude-*` and overstating cost roughly 5–25×. The forwarder now captures the real outbound model, attributes usage by upstream-echo then outbound then client alias, persists the actual pricing basis on every row (schema v11), and keeps that basis through cost backfill and 30-day rollup pruning; Claude Desktop traffic is now logged under its own `app_type` so its pricing overrides apply.
- **Usage Metering on Format-Conversion Proxy Paths**: Audited and fixed token/cache accounting across the proxy's format-conversion paths (Chat, Responses, and Gemini converted to Anthropic). The proxy now records the actually returned model, injects `stream_options.include_usage` so OpenAI-compatible upstreams emit usage in streaming, excludes `cache_read` and `cache_creation` from input on Claude←OpenAI paths to stop double-billing cache tokens, subtracts cached Gemini prompt tokens, still records fully-cached requests, and skips synthetic all-zero usage that previously inflated request counts (#2774).
- **In-App Update No Longer Hangs on Restart**: Installing an update from within the app no longer freezes on the "restarting" screen, leaving the new version installed but requiring a manual force-quit. The download-install-restart chain now runs entirely in the backend (a new `install_update_and_restart` command) with platform-aware install ordering and single-instance-lock teardown before re-exec, instead of depending on the old WebView to keep running JS after the app bundle was already swapped; exit requests are also classified so restart requests fall through to Tauri's default flow rather than deadlocking on the window-state plugin mutex (#4069, #4074).
- **Codex Upgrade No Longer Breaks the Install**: Upgrading Codex from the Settings "About" tab no longer leaves it throwing "Missing optional dependency @openai/codex-…" errors. The upgrade chain previously ran `codex update` first, which on an npm install is a bare reinstall that reports success even when the per-platform binary fails to land; Codex is now removed from the self-update-first path and a runnable check triggers an uninstall+reinstall self-heal (scoped to npm-managed installs) that actually re-lands the missing platform binary.
- **Codex OAuth Auth Token Preserved on Proxy Takeover**: Enabling proxy takeover for a Codex provider no longer strips the `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` placeholder, which previously broke Claude Code's login on hot-switches, fresh installs, and configs already stripped by older releases. The placeholder is now injected unconditionally for managed (non-Copilot) Codex providers, including URL-only ones; GitHub Copilot behavior (API_KEY only) is unchanged (#3789, #3784).
- **Takeover-Residue Recovery Across Config-Dir Switches**: Restarting the app after changing the config directory while proxy takeover is active no longer leaves Claude/Codex/Gemini pointed at a dead local proxy. The old instance now restores the taken-over live files before restarting, the first-run import refuses to persist a takeover placeholder as a provider, and SSOT restore validates that the current provider's config is free of placeholders before writing it back (#4076).
- **Mislabeled SSE Bodies in Format-Transform Fallback**: Requests routed through Claude/Codex format conversion no longer fail with an opaque 422 "Failed to parse upstream response" when a MaaS gateway force-streams a `stream:false` request and returns an SSE body under a non-SSE Content-Type. The proxy now sniffs for SSE on parse failure, aggregates the chunks into a single JSON, and runs the existing converter so clients still get a valid non-stream response; remaining parse failures are enriched with content-type, encoding, and body-snippet diagnostics, and deflate decoding now tries zlib before raw (#2234).
- **Duplicate YAML Keys in Hermes Config**: Hermes config writes no longer accumulate duplicate top-level keys (e.g. `mcp_servers`) that caused "Failed to parse Hermes config as YAML: duplicate entry with key" errors. Section replacement now strips all stale occurrences from the remainder instead of degrading into appends, the dedup safety net handles both LF and CRLF line endings, and healing keeps the last (newest) occurrence to match Hermes's own last-wins PyYAML semantics (#3267, #3633, #2973, #2529, #3310, #3762).
- **Usage Query Resilience and Error Clarity**: Usage cards no longer flip to red on a single transient blip: queries now retry once and keep showing the last successful result for up to 10 minutes on network/timeout/5xx failures, while deterministic failures (auth, empty key, unknown provider, 4xx) surface immediately and clear the snapshot so a stale quota can't resurface after credentials change. Native balance/coding-plan/subscription timeouts were raised from 10s to 15s for slow cross-border endpoints, and coding-plan now returns explicit "API key is empty" / "Unknown coding plan provider" errors instead of a blank failure.
- **Usage Script Provider Credential Resolution**: Custom JS-script usage queries resolved `{{apiKey}}` / `{{baseUrl}}` by guessing env fields only, so providers that store credentials elsewhere (e.g. Codex's `auth.OPENAI_API_KEY` plus `config.toml` base_url) always got empty values and failed despite being fully configured. Script queries and the test/preview now reuse the same per-app credential resolver as the native balance path, with explicit non-empty script values still taking precedence (#1479).
- **Claude Code Workflow Sub-Agent Usage Counted**: Local (no-proxy) session-log usage accounting missed Claude Code Workflow sub-agent traffic, under-counting overall usage by roughly 4.1% (concentrated in workflow/subagent transcripts). The scanner now descends into the deeper `subagents/workflows/wf_*/` transcript directories, and the parser no longer drops billable assistant messages that lack a `stop_reason` but already incurred input/cache token cost; dedup is unchanged so no usage is double-counted.
- **Codex Image Rectifier for /responses Text-Only Upstreams**: Codex `/responses` requests carrying images and routed to text-only OpenAI-chat models (e.g. DeepSeek `deepseek-v4-flash`) no longer fail with HTTP 400 "unknown variant `image_url`". The media rectifier now also covers the Codex adapter, scanning the responses `input` for `input_image` blocks so it can proactively strip images for known text-only models and reactively retry with images replaced on upstream image-unsupported errors.
- **Zhipu Coding-Plan Quota Window Mislabeling**: The Zhipu coding-plan view no longer swaps the 5-hour and weekly quota buckets in the final hours of each weekly cycle. The two windows are now classified by the explicit `unit` field (3 = 5-hour, 6 = weekly) instead of by sorting reset-time ascending, which mislabeled them exactly when users check their weekly quota most; the old reset-time heuristic remains as a fallback (#3036).
- **Duplicate Provider Terminal Sessions on macOS**: Launching a provider terminal on macOS no longer opens an extra empty window alongside the command session; Terminal.app uses `launch` (not `activate`) on cold start and Ghostty uses an initial-command so a single session opens, with a fallback retained if the AppleScript path fails (#4156).
- **Claude Desktop Model-Mapping Placeholders**: The Claude Desktop model-mapping form previously showed mismatched example brands across the menu display name and request model columns (DeepSeek vs Kimi), implying a display name maps to an unrelated model. Both placeholders are now derived from each row's role so they stay brand-consistent, with the lightweight Haiku tier using a flash example.
- **Popovers Behind Fullscreen Panels**: Popovers and tooltips such as the provider preset search no longer render behind fullscreen panels and appear unresponsive on click; their z-index is raised above the fullscreen overlay while staying below modal dialogs.
- **ToggleRow Icon Shrinking**: Toggle row icons no longer shrink or distort when paired with long descriptions, keeping the icon at a fixed size next to multi-line text.

### Docs

- **Release Notes Contributor Mentions**: Restored contributor mentions in the v3.16.1 and v3.16.2 release notes across all three locales.

## [3.16.2] - 2026-06-07

Development since v3.16.1 focuses on broadening data portability and usage observability — S3-compatible cloud sync, OpenCode session usage import, and an opt-in official-subscription quota template — while hardening Codex Chat Completions routing (stream truncation, `tool_choice` / custom-tool / reasoning-token edge cases, file and audio attachments, and a Codex CLI models endpoint), strengthening proxy robustness (ephemeral ports, takeover/placeholder restore, system-message normalization, clearer upstream errors, and a text-only image fallback), fixing coding-plan quota lookups (Zhipu, MiniMax) and several Windows/macOS issues, adding the CherryIN and ZenMux providers, and refreshing the user manual.

**Stats**: 41 commits | 132 files changed | +11,116 insertions | -1,636 deletions

### Added

- **S3-Compatible Cloud Sync**: Cloud Sync now supports S3-compatible object storage as a second backend alongside WebDAV, using hand-rolled AWS Signature V4 signing for broad compatibility. The settings panel offers one-click presets for AWS S3, MinIO, Cloudflare R2, Alibaba Cloud OSS, Tencent Cloud COS, and Huawei OBS plus a custom endpoint, with connection testing, manual upload/download, and auto-sync on configuration changes (provider, endpoint, MCP, prompt, skill, settings, and proxy tables — not high-frequency data like usage logs); enabling S3 sync disables active WebDAV sync and vice versa (#1351).
- **OpenCode Session Usage Sync**: Added OpenCode as a usage-statistics source that imports per-message token, cost, and model data from OpenCode's local SQLite database, with a new "OpenCode" app filter tab and an "OpenCode Session" data-source label. The database path respects `OPENCODE_DB` and `XDG_DATA_HOME` (defaulting to `~/.local/share/opencode` on all platforms), only finalized messages are imported, and the freshness check accounts for the WAL file so newly written sessions are not skipped (#3215).
- **Official Subscription Quota Template**: Added an explicit, opt-in "official subscription" usage template for Claude, Codex, and Gemini official providers that queries plan quota via CLI/OAuth credentials, replacing the previous implicit auto-query. It is disabled by default and enabled from the usage-script modal with a configurable refresh interval.
- **Unsupported Image Fallback Rectifier**: Added a proxy rectifier that replaces Anthropic image blocks with an `[Unsupported Image]` marker when the routed model is text-only (declared, or detected via a built-in model-name heuristic) or when the upstream rejects image input, so conversations are not interrupted. A new Settings toggle controls the fallback, with a separate toggle for the heuristic detection.
- **ZenMux Token Plan Provider**: Added ZenMux as a Token Plan coding-plan provider that accepts a manually entered API key and base URL in the usage-script modal and renders its quota with USD-denominated used / limit values (#2709).
- **CherryIN Preset**: Added the CherryIN aggregator gateway as a quick-config preset across all seven supported apps — Anthropic-format endpoint for Claude Code / Claude Desktop / OpenClaw / Hermes, `@ai-sdk/anthropic` for OpenCode, the OpenAI-compatible endpoint for Codex, and the Gemini-compatible endpoint for Gemini CLI — with the official brand icon, placed next to AiHubMix (#3643).
- **CCSub Preset**: Added CCSub, a multi-model aggregator partner, as a quick-config preset across six apps — Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Codex, OpenCode, OpenClaw, and Hermes — with the official brand icon and the partner referral link prefilled as the API-key signup URL (`gpt-5.5` for the OpenAI-compatible Codex and OpenCode endpoints).
- **Codex CLI Models Endpoint**: The local proxy now answers `GET /v1/models`, which Codex CLI probes at startup, returning the cc-switch-managed Codex model catalog. A stale-catalog guard parses the live `config.toml` and only serves the catalog when `model_catalog_json` still references the cc-switch-owned file, so a leftover catalog from a previous provider is not advertised (#3818).
- **Codex Chat File and Audio Attachments**: The Codex Responses-to-Chat converter now maps `input_file` parts (carrying `file_id` or inline `file_data`) and `input_audio` parts into their Chat Completions equivalents, and emits top-level `input_*` items that were previously dropped, so file and audio attachments reach Chat-only Codex upstreams.

### Changed

- **Usage Dashboard Hero Redesign**: Restructured the Usage Dashboard hero and summary cards into a more compact layout, consolidating the real-token total, request count, and cost into a single top row (#3426).
- **SSSAiCode Endpoint Refresh**: Updated the SSSAiCode preset's website, signup, and API base URLs to the `sssaicodeapi.com` domain and refreshed its endpoint nodes (default `node-hk.sssaicodeapi.com`, plus `node-hk.sssaiapi.com` and `node-cf.sssaicodeapi.com`) across all seven app presets.

### Fixed

- **Codex Chat Truncated Stream Detection**: When a Chat Completions upstream ends a stream without a `finish_reason` or `[DONE]`, CC Switch no longer reports it as a normal completion — it finalizes normally only when the stream truly finished, emits an incomplete (`max_output_tokens`) response when partial output was produced, and emits a failed `stream_truncated` event when nothing was produced. Late-arriving reasoning is also attached to still-active streamed tool calls.
- **Codex Chat `tool_choice` Without Tools**: The Responses-to-Chat converter now drops `tool_choice` and `parallel_tool_calls` whenever the resulting tools array is absent or empty, so strict OpenAI-compatible upstreams (vLLM, enterprise gateways) no longer reject the request with "When using `tool_choice`, `tools` must be set." (#3640).
- **Codex Custom Tool Metadata Over Chat Routing**: Custom Codex tools (such as the freeform `apply_patch` tool) now preserve their full original definition — including format and grammar metadata — as a compact, order-stable JSON block in the generated Chat function description instead of a generic placeholder, keeping them usable on Chat Completions upstreams (#3644).
- **Codex Chat `reasoning_tokens` in Usage**: The Chat-to-Responses usage conversion now always includes `output_tokens_details.reasoning_tokens` (defaulting to 0), even when a provider omits `completion_tokens_details` or returns it as a non-object, satisfying the Codex CLI's strict requirement and avoiding repeated parse failures and retries (#3514).
- **Codex Cross-Turn Reasoning for Custom and Search Tools**: The cross-turn reasoning cache in Codex Chat history now covers the full tool-call set (`function_call`, `custom_tool_call`, `tool_search_call`) and their outputs, so `apply_patch` and tool-search calls keep their `reasoning_content` when restored via `previous_response_id`.
- **Ephemeral Proxy Port Resolution**: When the proxy listens on port 0 (OS-assigned), takeover now starts the proxy first to learn the real port and writes it into the Live configs and database, so client URLs no longer point at a broken `:0` address; the Claude Desktop gateway URL is rejected if no concrete port has been resolved.
- **Proxy Placeholder Backup/Restore Loop**: If a previous proxy stop left the proxy placeholders in Live, taking over again no longer overwrites a good backup with the proxy config, and restore no longer writes the placeholder back to Live — both paths detect the placeholder state and rebuild Live from the current provider, fixing cases where the proxy toggle became a no-op and clients stayed pinned to the local proxy (#3689).
- **Official Provider Block Under Proxy Takeover**: While Local Routing takeover is active, only providers explicitly categorized as official are blocked from switching, instead of also disabling custom providers whose endpoint lives in metadata or whose fields are unfilled. The disabled Enable button now shows a lighter hint tooltip in place of the red "Blocked" badge.
- **Localhost Listen Address Normalization**: Saving the proxy with a listen address of `localhost` now normalizes it to `127.0.0.1` before persisting, avoiding binding inconsistencies (#3016).
- **Anthropic System Message Normalization**: For Anthropic-format providers, system-role entries inside the `messages` array are collapsed and merged into the top-level `system` field (preserving order and any existing top-level system), preventing strict upstreams from rejecting non-leading system messages; OpenAI Chat routing is untouched (#3775).
- **Claude Desktop 1M-Context Model Routing**: Claude Desktop appends a `[1m]` marker to the model name when the 1M-context beta is active (e.g. `claude-opus-4-8[1m]`). The proxy now strips that suffix before route lookup so exact, alias, legacy, and role-keyword matching resolve correctly, fixing `route_unknown` (HTTP 400) failures when switching to a 1M-capable model mid-conversation.
- **Codex 413 Error Clarity**: When a Codex upstream gateway rejects an oversized request with HTTP 413, the proxy now returns a dedicated message identifying it as the provider's server-side body-size limit (not a CC Switch limit) with recovery steps (run `/compact`, drop large logs or inline images, or ask the provider to raise its limit), instead of echoing the raw upstream HTML page.
- **Proxy Panel Error Detail**: When toggling proxy takeover fails, the proxy panel toast now includes the underlying backend error detail instead of only a generic failure message (#3656).
- **Copilot Infinite-Whitespace Threshold**: Raised the streaming infinite-whitespace abort threshold from 20 to 500 consecutive whitespace characters, so legitimate tool calls with deeply indented code arguments are no longer falsely aborted while still catching the real Copilot infinite-whitespace bug (#2647).
- **Subscription Tier Tray Rendering**: Fixed tray and quota rendering for official subscription tiers via a unified tier-to-label mapping: Claude/Codex no longer drop the seven-day window, Gemini Pro/Flash/Flash-Lite tiers no longer leak raw machine names, and multi-window plans (e.g. Opus + Sonnet) now display the worst utilization instead of the first match.
- **Inflated Claude Stream Input Tokens**: Some Anthropic-compatible streaming providers (e.g. Qwen, MiniMax) report the full context as `input_tokens` in `message_start`, double-counting the cached portion and artificially lowering the displayed cache hit rate. The parser now prefers a smaller positive `input_tokens` from `message_delta` and adopts the paired cache counts from the same usage block; native Claude and OpenRouter-converted paths are unchanged.
- **Zhipu Quota Query Endpoint Routing**: The Zhipu coding-plan quota lookup was hard-coded to `api.z.ai`, so users on the mainland China preset (`open.bigmodel.cn`) could not retrieve usage when the international endpoint was unreachable. The quota request now routes to the host matching the user's configured base URL (#3702).
- **MiniMax Balance API and Pricing**: Adapted MiniMax coding-plan quota to its new balance API (which returns remaining-percent fields instead of usage counts that broke the old parser and left the tray blank), filtered out non-coding models (e.g. video), handled plans without a weekly limit, and seeded default pricing for MiniMax M3 (#3518).
- **GLM Coding Plan Endpoints and Model Fetch**: Corrected the ZhiPu / Z.AI GLM Coding Plan presets to the `/api/coding/paas/v4` endpoints across Codex, OpenCode, OpenClaw, and Hermes, and taught the model-list probe to query `{base}/models` for base URLs that already end in a `/v{N}` segment (keeping `/v1/models` as a fallback), so the Fetch Models button no longer 404s on versioned endpoints (#3524).
- **Codex Model Catalog Path Portability**: Codex now writes only the relative filename `cc-switch-model-catalog.json` to `config.toml` instead of an absolute path (Codex CLI resolves it from the config directory), fixing the model catalog breaking on WSL and symlinked setups where the absolute path could not be translated (#3614).
- **APINebula OpenCode SDK**: The APINebula OpenCode preset now loads `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` instead of `@ai-sdk/openai`, so requests use the OpenAI Chat Completions format the relay expects rather than the Responses API.
- **Windows Tray Icon Residue on Exit**: Quitting CC Switch on Windows could leave a dead tray icon until hovered; the app now removes the tray icon before exiting so it disappears cleanly (#3797).
- **Windows Taskbar Icon**: Set an explicit Windows AppUserModelID at runtime and stamped the installer's desktop and start-menu shortcuts with the same ID and product icon, so CC Switch shows the correct icon and groups properly in the taskbar (#3457).
- **Windows Subdirectory Skill Updates**: Normalized backslash path separators to forward slashes when scanning installed skills on Windows, so skills nested in subdirectories (e.g. `skills/my-skill`) are matched by the update check instead of being silently skipped (#3430).
- **macOS Input Auto-Capitalization**: Disabled autocomplete, autocorrect, autocapitalize, and spellcheck on the shared text Input component so macOS no longer auto-capitalizes or auto-corrects the first letter typed into configuration fields (#3626).
- **Codex VS Code Session Previews**: Codex session previews for requests sent from VS Code could show selection or open-file content instead of the prompt when a markdown heading preceded the injected request. Both the backend title and frontend preview now match the last "## My request for Codex:" heading (the IDE injects the real request as the final section) (#3593).
- **VS Code Wording in Chinese UI**: Corrected the "Apply to Claude Code plugin" description in the Simplified and Traditional Chinese locales to write "VS Code" properly instead of "Vscode", aligning with the English and Japanese strings (#3228).

### Docs

- **User Manual Refresh**: Refreshed the README locales and the en / zh / ja user manuals to reflect all seven supported apps (adding Claude Desktop and Hermes), corrected the OpenCode config path to `~/.config/opencode/` (`opencode.json`), documented Hermes configuration files, updated the language docs to four languages, revised per-app MCP / Prompts / Skills availability, noted that export produces a timestamped SQL backup including usage logs, and documented the pricing model-ID matching rules (#3411).
- **Codex Official Auth Preservation Guide**: Added a trilingual (en / zh / ja) guide explaining how to keep Codex official remote control and plugins working while routing model traffic to third-party APIs, and linked it from the v3.16.1 release notes.
- **README Release-Note Links and Sponsor Markup**: Updated the Release Notes links in all README locales to point at v3.16.1 and fixed broken smart-quote characters in the README_ZH sponsor blocks so their HTML attributes render correctly (#3772).

## [3.16.1] - 2026-06-01

Development since v3.16.0 focuses on hardening Codex provider switching and Local Routing takeover: preserving official OAuth auth and model catalogs across normal switches, hot-switches, backup restore, and edit flows; restoring Codex Chat tool/plugin compatibility over Chat Completions upstreams; improving Codex proxy diagnostics and CLI discovery; and documenting DeepSeek routing.

**Stats**: 23 commits | 62 files changed | +5,603 insertions | -1,113 deletions

### Added

- **Codex Official Auth Preservation Setting**: Added an opt-in setting that keeps the official ChatGPT / Codex OAuth login in `auth.json` when switching third-party Codex providers, while moving third-party provider tokens into `config.toml` when enabled.
- **Codex DeepSeek Routing Guides**: Added localized DeepSeek routing guides for Codex in English, Chinese, and Japanese, with screenshots covering provider routing requirements, Codex provider setup, and Local Routing takeover.

### Changed

- **Codex Auth Preservation Is Opt-In**: The new official-auth preservation setting now defaults to off, so third-party Codex switches keep the legacy behavior of writing the active provider auth unless users explicitly enable preservation.
- **Codex Provider Switch Restart Hint**: Successful Codex provider switches now tell users to restart the Codex client so catalog and config changes take effect.
- **Codex Proxy Takeover Switching Is Serialized**: Provider switches and takeover toggles now share a per-app lock and use backup / live placeholder ownership signals instead of lagging `enabled` or server-running flags, preventing normal live writes from racing a just-activated or temporarily stopped takeover.
- **Codex Takeover Hot-Switch Display Refresh**: Hot-switching a Codex provider while Local Routing owns Live now refreshes the proxy-safe live provider id, model, and display name while keeping endpoints pointed at the local proxy.
- **Sponsor Ordering**: Swapped the Shengsuanyun and AICodeMirror sponsor blocks across README locales.
- **Docs Organization**: Moved the Chinese proxy guide under `docs/guides/` and removed the obsolete working-directory plan document.

### Fixed

- **Codex Provider Edit Dialog Under Takeover**: The Codex provider edit form now shows an explicit notice and storage-aware auth / config hints clarifying that it displays the stored provider config (not the proxy-managed live `auth.json` / `config.toml`), so the official OAuth token is no longer mistaken as lost while takeover is active. The dialog also treats takeover as active regardless of whether the proxy server is currently running.
- **Codex OAuth Auth During Proxy Takeover**: Fixed multiple preserve-mode takeover paths that could clear or overwrite the official ChatGPT / Codex OAuth `auth.json`. Takeover detection now recognizes `PROXY_MANAGED` in `config.toml`, cleanup only removes placeholder bearer tokens, config-only takeover writes are used consistently, and mis-categorized third-party providers no longer trigger the official-provider auth overwrite path. Provider sync and switching now treat the restore backup and live placeholders as the takeover-ownership signal (instead of the lagging `enabled` / proxy-running flags) and serialize switch/takeover per app, so a just-activated or proxy-stopped takeover can no longer be overwritten by a normal live write.
- **Codex Model Catalog Data Loss**: Fixed cases where Codex `modelCatalog` could be wiped by live-config backfill, active-provider edit dialogs, provider switches, or proxy takeover-off restore. Snapshot backups now keep existing `model_catalog_json` pointers, provider-rebuilt backups regenerate the catalog projection from the database source of truth, active edit dialogs prefer the DB catalog over lossy Live reconstruction, and provider switches always refresh the generated catalog JSON.
- **Codex Chat Tools Over Chat Completions Routing**: Restored Codex `tool_search`, loaded namespace tools, custom tools, and tool outputs when third-party Codex providers are routed through Chat Completions. Non-streaming and streaming Chat responses now map back to the right Responses item types, including native `response.custom_tool_call_input.*` events for custom-tool streaming.
- **Codex Proxy Error Diagnostics**: Codex forwarding failures now return richer JSON errors with provider, model, endpoint, upstream status, stable `cc_switch_*` codes, and HTTP statuses aligned with the canonical `ProxyError` response mapping.
- **Codex Native Balance / Coding-Plan Queries**: Fixed native usage and plan lookups so each app resolves the correct provider credentials instead of leaking assumptions from another app surface.
- **Codex CLI Discovery and Catalog Projection**: Fixed third-party Codex catalog projection that could fail when the Codex CLI was not reachable through one narrow PATH lookup, by adding multi-platform CLI discovery plus a bundled GPT-5.5 model-catalog template fallback.
- **Claude Desktop Official Provider Creation**: Fixed adding the Claude Desktop Official provider when the official category/config path was selected.
- **Anthropic Tool Thinking History for Kimi / Moonshot**: Added Kimi and Moonshot to the Anthropic-compatible tool-thinking history normalizer so later turns can replay reasoning and tool-call context correctly.
- **Windows Tool Version Probing**: Fixed Windows version checks that could misquote `.cmd` / `.bat` commands and decode localized command output as mojibake, causing working tools to appear as "installed but not runnable".

## [3.16.0] - 2026-05-29

Development since v3.15.0 focuses on making third-party Codex providers work like first-class citizens through Chat Completions routing, stabilizing Codex provider identity and history, adding an in-app managed CLI tool lifecycle, expanding the partner preset catalog, refreshing the default model / pricing matrix around GPT-5.5 and Claude Opus 4.8, and improving usage observability, localization, docs, and proxy robustness.

**Stats**: 101 commits | 221 files changed | +27,063 insertions | -3,052 deletions

### Highlights

- **Codex Chat Completions routing**: Codex providers can now be served by OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions upstreams. CC Switch converts Codex Responses requests into Chat Completions, rebuilds JSON and SSE responses back into Responses shape, preserves reasoning / `<think>` / tool-call state, normalizes error envelopes, and probes Chat-format providers correctly in Stream Check.
- **Codex third-party provider state is unified and safer**: third-party Codex providers now share the stable `custom` model-provider bucket, with a one-shot migration for historical JSONL sessions and `state_5.sqlite` threads, plus fixes that preserve OAuth login state, user-selected catalog models, and user-authored provider ids during live reads / switches.
- **Managed CLI tool management**: the About page is now a tool management panel for Claude, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, OpenClaw, and Hermes, with install / update actions, update-all, conflict diagnostics, source-aware anchored upgrades, WSL handling, and visible "installed but not runnable" states.
- **Provider ecosystem and model matrix refresh**: added APIKEY.FUN, APINebula, AtlasCloud, SudoCode, Xiaomi MiMo Token Plan, and Claude Desktop Official presets; refreshed partner links and default models / pricing across apps; upgraded the default Claude Opus model line to 4.8 and GPT defaults to 5.5 where applicable.
- **Usage and docs polish**: Usage Dashboard updates now react immediately when logs are written, custom usage-script summaries and subagent session-log accounting were fixed, Traditional Chinese UI localization landed, and a German README plus expanded Claude Desktop / Codex Chat / tool-management manuals were added.
- **Proxy and conversion hardening**: fixed Codex Chat reasoning / cache / usage edge cases, DeepSeek Anthropic tool-thinking history, Claude-compatible empty `tool_calls` streams, managed-account takeover auth, MiMo reasoning output, Gemini Native tool-call replay, and several panic-prone proxy paths.

### Added

- **Codex Chat Completions Routing**: Codex providers can now be served by upstreams that only speak the OpenAI Chat Completions API. CC Switch's local proxy converts Codex's outgoing Responses requests into Chat Completions and rebuilds the Chat response (both JSON and SSE) back into Responses shape, preserving `reasoning_content`, inline `<think>` blocks, streamed reasoning summaries, tool calls, and `previous_response_id` follow-ups. A bounded Codex Chat history cache restores tool calls before their tool outputs.
- **22 Codex Third-Party Provider Presets with Chat Routing**: Enabled Chat Completions routing with explicit model catalogs for major Chinese/Asian providers — DeepSeek, Zhipu GLM (+ en), Kimi, MiniMax (+ en), StepFun (+ en), Baidu Qianfan Coding Plan, Bailian, ModelScope, Longcat, BaiLing, Xiaomi MiMo (+ Token Plan), Volcengine Agentplan, BytePlus, DouBao Seed, SiliconFlow (+ en), Novita AI, and Nvidia. Each preset declares its context window so the UI can size the model-mapping rows.
- **Codex Model Mapping Table**: Codex provider forms now expose a model catalog (model + display name + context window per row) that is the single source of truth for the upstream model list, projected to `~/.codex/cc-switch-model-catalog.json`.
- **Codex Chat Providers in Stream Check**: Stream Check now probes Chat-format Codex providers against `/chat/completions` with a Chat-shaped body instead of `/v1/responses`, and aligns its URL fallback order with the production `CodexAdapter` (origin-only base URLs hit `/v1/<endpoint>` first) so a non-404 error on the bare path no longer flags a working provider as down.
- **Codex Chat Reasoning Auto-Detection**: When a Codex provider is served through Chat Completions routing, CC Switch now auto-detects the upstream's reasoning interface from its name, base URL, and model — injecting the correct thinking parameter (`thinking:{type}`, `enable_thinking`, `reasoning_split`, top-level `reasoning_effort`, or OpenRouter's native `reasoning:{effort}` object) with no manual setup. Aggregator/hosting platforms (OpenRouter, SiliconFlow) are matched platform-first, since the same model can expose different reasoning controls on different platforms. Providers that only expose a thinking on/off switch (Kimi, GLM, Qwen, MiniMax, MiMo, SiliconFlow) drop the effort *level* instead of forwarding an unsupported field — so changing Codex's reasoning effort has no effect for them — while providers with real effort tiers (DeepSeek, OpenRouter, and StepFun's `step-3.5-flash-2603` only) pass the level through. OpenRouter specifically uses the native `reasoning:{effort}` object, clamps `max` to `xhigh` (its enum has no `max`), and forwards an explicit `effort:"none"` so reasoning can be turned off.
- **Codex Goal Mode and Remote Compaction Controls**: Codex config editing now exposes a Goal Mode toggle and a Remote Compaction toggle for third-party providers; new Codex templates default to `disable_response_storage = true` while still allowing explicit goal support.
- **Xiaomi MiMo Token Plan Presets**: Added Xiaomi MiMo Token Plan presets with specs aligned to the official documentation (#2803).
- **Claude Desktop Official Preset**: Added a Claude Desktop Official preset that restores the native Claude Desktop login, plus a localized Claude Desktop user guide (en / zh / ja).
- **Managed CLI Tool Lifecycle**: Added silent install / update commands for managed CLI tools, latest-version checks, per-tool and batch actions, update-all, and diagnostics for multiple installations across PATH, Homebrew, npm, pnpm, bun, volta, fnm, nvm, scoop, WinGet, Windows native paths, and WSL.
- **Source-Aware Tool Diagnostics**: The Settings / About surface can now diagnose conflicting tool installations, show the concrete install source and version for each path, and generate backend-planned upgrade commands anchored to the actual installation source.
- **Real-Time Usage Refresh**: The backend now emits `usage-log-recorded` when proxy logs, session-log syncs, or rollups write usage data; Usage Dashboard listens for that event and invalidates its queries immediately instead of waiting for the next polling interval (#3027).
- **Traditional Chinese Localization**: Added `zh-TW` UI localization and a settings language option (#3093).
- **German README**: Added `README_DE.md` and linked it from the existing README language switchers (#2994).
- **New Partner Presets**: Added APIKEY.FUN, APINebula, AtlasCloud, and SudoCode partner presets across the supported app surfaces, with partner copy, icons, and README entries.

### Changed

- **Codex Third-Party Providers Unified into a "custom" History Bucket**: Codex filters resume history by `model_provider`, so switching between provider-specific ids made past sessions appear to vanish. All third-party providers now normalize to a single stable `custom` bucket (reserved built-in ids like `openai` / `ollama` are preserved), with a one-shot device migration that rewrites historical JSONL sessions and the `state_5.sqlite` threads table and backs up originals under `~/.cc-switch/backups/codex-history-provider-migration-v1/`.
- **Codex Provider Form Simplified**: Removed the API Format selector from the Codex form (`wire_api` is always `responses`, so the selector misleadingly implied a protocol change); the model mapping table is now the only source of truth with no hidden default entries, and the form notes that a Codex restart is required after catalog changes since `model_catalog_json` is loaded at startup. Only the "Needs Local Routing" toggle remains.
- **Codex Local Routing Toggle Hints Rewritten**: Reframed the OFF / ON hints as action guidance (when to enable) rather than scenario descriptions, synced across zh / en / ja.
- **Codex Live Config Preservation**: Live Codex config reads no longer force-rewrite a user's `model_provider` field, and provider-scoped `experimental_bearer_token` handling now preserves OAuth login state when switching between third-party providers.
- **Tool Install / Upgrade Strategy**: Managed tool installation now prefers official native installers where available, falls back to package managers when appropriate, runs self-update first for compatible tools, anchors upgrades to the detected install source, and locks duplicate batch actions while work is in flight.
- **About Page Becomes Tool Management**: The About settings page now presents installed / latest versions, install and update actions, conflict diagnostics, WSL shell preferences, and clearer status for broken or unrunnable tools.
- **Default Models and Pricing Refreshed**: Upgraded the default Claude Opus model to 4.8, moved GPT-based presets and templates to GPT-5.5 where applicable, refreshed pricing seeds, aligned Claude Desktop model mapping with Claude Code's three-role tiers, and renamed the OpenCode Go preset to drop a stale model suffix.
- **Partner Links Refreshed**: Updated ShengSuanYun referral links, Atlas Cloud UTM links, and partner copy across README locales and provider metadata.
- **Homebrew Official Cask Installation**: Installation simplified to `brew install --cask cc-switch` now that CC Switch is in the official Homebrew repository; the personal-tap requirement was removed from all READMEs.
- **Shared Frontend Utilities**: Replaced JSON stringify / parse deep-copy patterns with a shared `deepClone` helper and extracted a shared `useTauriEvent` hook (#3140).

### Fixed

- **Codex Chat Error Responses Converted to Responses Envelope**: The Codex Chat-to-Responses bridge previously passed upstream error bodies through untouched, leaving Codex clients unable to recognize MiniMax `base_resp`, raw OpenAI Chat errors, or plain-text / HTML error pages. Errors are now regularized into the standard `{error: {message, type, code, param}}` envelope with the original HTTP status preserved; non-JSON bodies are wrapped and truncated to 1KB at a UTF-8 char boundary. Also fixed a pre-existing append-vs-insert bug that emitted a duplicate `Content-Type` header on rewritten JSON bodies.
- **Codex Mid-Stream System Messages Collapsed**: MiniMax's OpenAI-compatible endpoint strict-rejects any non-leading `system` message (error 2013). All `system` fragments are now collapsed into a single leading message (joined in original order), losslessly for permissive backends too.
- **Codex Model Catalog Wiped After Restart**: Editing the active Codex provider triggered a live read that omitted `modelCatalog`, so a subsequent save silently destroyed user-configured model mappings. Live reads now reverse-parse the on-disk catalog projection to round-trip the same shape the save path writes.
- **Codex Model Catalog Infinite Render Loop**: Broke a bidirectional sync cycle between the catalog table and its parent state that caused severe UI jittering when adding or editing entries.
- **Codex Chat Preserves User-Selected Catalog Model**: A model the client selects from the catalog (e.g. via `/model`) is no longer overwritten by `config.toml`'s default model.
- **Codex Chat Reasoning and Cache Stability**: Restored a unique call-id fallback when Codex omits or rewrites `previous_response_id`, stopped deriving cache identity from `previous_response_id`, and canonicalized parseable JSON string payloads in tool conversions for stable prefix-cache reuse.
- **Codex Chat Streaming Usage Recovered**: The Responses-to-Chat conversion now injects `stream_options.include_usage` (merging into any client-provided `stream_options`) when a request is streaming, so OpenAI-compatible upstreams like Kimi and MiniMax emit the trailing usage chunk again. Previously their streamed token / cost / cache stats were recorded as zero on the Codex Chat path.
- **Codex Chat Tool-Call Reasoning Backfill**: Thinking models like Kimi/Moonshot and DeepSeek reject an assistant message that carries `tool_calls` without a non-empty `reasoning_content`. When cross-turn history recovery misses (proxy restart, ambiguous `call_id`, or a turn with no upstream reasoning), a placeholder `reasoning_content` is now backfilled in a final pass — genuine trailing reasoning still attaches first — so the request no longer fails with `reasoning_content is missing in assistant tool call message`.
- **Managed-Account Claude Takeover Auth**: Managed-account providers (GitHub Copilot / Codex OAuth) now drop token env keys and write only the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` placeholder when taking over Claude Live config, with an outbound guard that refuses to send the `PROXY_MANAGED` placeholder upstream.
- **Claude Desktop Profile Sync During Takeover**: Claude Desktop profile data is now synced during proxy takeover, model routes align with the Claude Code three-role tiers, and the Cowork egress profile has been corrected (#3157, #3172).
- **Managed-Account Takeover Model Fields**: Local Routing now sources takeover model fields from the target provider on managed accounts instead of carrying stale model values.
- **DeepSeek Anthropic Tool Thinking History**: Normalized DeepSeek Anthropic-compatible tool-thinking history so later turns can replay reasoning / tool-call context without malformed messages (#3203).
- **Claude-Compatible Empty Tool Calls in Streams**: Fixed a Claude-compatible streaming edge case where an empty `tool_calls` array reset block state and broke streamed responses (#2915).
- **MiMo Reasoning for Claude Code Proxy**: Added MiMo `reasoning_content` support on the Claude Code proxy path (#2990).
- **Gemini Native Tool-Call Robustness**: Fixed `functionResponse.name` resolution (422) and `thought_signature` replay (400) for synthesized tool-call IDs in long multi-turn sessions (#2814).
- **Session Log Subagent Token Accounting**: `collect_jsonl_files()` now scans subagent JSONL logs that were previously missed, so subagent token usage is counted in session cost (session-log mode only) (#2821).
- **Usage Dashboard / Sync Stability**: Fixed a Codex usage-sync panic on non-ASCII model names, custom usage-script summaries, and missing real-time refresh after usage rollups (#3027, #3129).
- **ZhiPu Coding-Plan Quota Tier Ordering**: When the 5-hour bucket is at 0% utilization, ZhiPu's API omits `nextResetTime`; the old `i64::MAX` sentinel sorted those entries last, letting the weekly bucket incorrectly claim the five-hour slot. Tiers now sort so a missing `nextResetTime` maps to the five-hour bucket, so tray and usage quota display stays correct for ZhiPu coding plans.
- **Skills Install by Key**: Installing from skills.sh search results now uses the unique key instead of the directory name, so skills that share a directory name install the correct one (#2784); also fixed a skill sync copy fallback (#2791).
- **Usage Price Input Precision**: Reduced the price input step to 0.0001 so sub-cent costs like DeepSeek cache reads can be entered (#2793, closes #2503).
- **Ghostty Clean Window Launch**: Ghostty now opens a single clean window instead of cloning existing tabs, and other terminals open a new window via `open -na` (#2801, closes #2798).
- **Tool Version and Update Reliability**: Version probing no longer masks unrunnable installs, prerelease tools are handled correctly in version checks, batch updates run per tool, install / update buttons stay locked during preflight, anchored upgrade branches enforce absolute paths, and WSL installer paths use native Unix installers when needed.
- **Codex mise Detection**: Fixed Codex mise environment detection (#2822).
- **Codex Archived Sessions**: Codex archived sessions are now included in session discovery (#2861).
- **Codex Chat Empty Tool Arguments**: Empty tool-call argument payloads are coerced to `{}` during Codex Chat conversion so upstreams and clients receive valid JSON.
- **Claude Provider Deeplink Imports**: Importing Claude providers through deeplinks now preserves custom environment fields (#2928).
- **OMO Recommended Models**: Synced OMO recommended models with upstream defaults and improved Fill Recommended feedback.
- **ShengSuanYun Model IDs Prefixed for Routing**: ShengSuanYun (胜算云) presets now carry the vendor prefixes the upstream gateway requires — `anthropic/…`, `google/…`, and `openai/…` (e.g. `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6`, `google/gemini-3.1-pro-preview`) — across the Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, and OpenClaw presets, including the Claude Code routing env (`ANTHROPIC_MODEL` / `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_{HAIKU,SONNET,OPUS}_MODEL`), so they resolve to valid upstream models instead of failing to route.
- **ClaudeAPI Model Test Re-Enabled**: Reclassified the ClaudeAPI preset (Claude Code and Claude Desktop) from `third_party` to `aggregator` so its model test button is no longer disabled by the third-party Claude gate; the partner star is unaffected since it is driven by `isPartner`, not category.
- **About Version Check**: Version checks now handle prerelease tool versions without misclassifying update state.
- **App Switcher Text Clipping**: Removed a fixed width constraint that clipped app-switcher text (#3161).
- **useEffect Race Condition**: Added an active-flag pattern to App.tsx effects to prevent listener leaks on unmount, and guarded against storing `undefined` language in localStorage (#2827).

### Removed

- **LionCC Sponsor and Presets**: Removed the LionCC sponsor entry and LionCCAPI presets across READMEs, provider configs, and locales (icon asset retained).
- **AICoding Partner Entry**: Removed the AICoding partner from README sponsor listings, provider presets, and i18n metadata.
- **Kimi For Coding Codex Preset**: Removed the Kimi For Coding preset from the Codex preset catalog.
- **CLI Uninstall Command Hints**: Dropped generated CLI uninstall command hints from the tool-management UI while keeping conflict diagnostics visible.

### Docs

- **Codex Chat Provider Support**: Documented Chat Completions routing, provider support, reasoning auto-detection, and Local Routing guidance in the changelog and user manual.
- **Settings Manual Refresh**: Updated settings documentation for the new managed tool lifecycle and Hermes installer behavior.
- **Claude Desktop Guide**: Added localized Claude Desktop guide pages and screenshots for provider setup, import, model mapping, and Local Routing context.
- **Installation Docs**: Updated installation docs and READMEs to recommend the official Homebrew cask and refreshed the v3.15.0 release-note imposter-site warning wording across locales.

## [3.15.0] - 2026-05-16

Development since v3.14.1 focuses on a dedicated Claude Desktop surface with third-party provider switching through a proxy gateway, a large reverse-proxy hardening pass (reliability, retries, cache, takeover, Gemini/Vertex/Codex paths), expansion of the third-party provider preset catalog (BytePlus / Volcengine / ClaudeAPI / ClaudeCN / RunAPI / RelaxyCode / PatewayAI / Baidu Qianfan), role-based model mapping with a 1M context flag, Codex OAuth live model discovery, and a long tail of usage, OAuth, Codex, and session quality-of-life fixes.

**Stats**: 127 commits | 211 files changed | +17,980 insertions | -2,748 deletions

### Highlights

- **Claude Desktop becomes a first-class managed surface** with third-party provider switching through an in-app proxy gateway, role-based model mapping (sonnet / opus / haiku) with a 1M context flag, Copilot/Codex OAuth provider reuse, and 44 imported provider presets translated from the Claude Code catalog. Note: 20 Claude Desktop presets now default to direct mode instead of routing through the proxy — verify connectivity if you previously relied on proxy routing for these presets.
- **Major reverse-proxy hardening**: P0–P3 lifecycle, retry, failover, and rectifier patches; pooled HTTPS reuse for non-Anthropic backends; Codex/Responses cache hit-rate improvements; correct Anthropic ↔ OpenAI `tool_choice` mapping; Vertex AI URL preservation; Gemini path-based model extraction; takeover detection refinement; IPv6 listen address support.
- **Provider Ecosystem Expansion**: Added BytePlus, Volcengine Agentplan, ClaudeAPI, ClaudeCN, RunAPI, RelaxyCode, PatewayAI, and Baidu Qianfan Coding Plan partner presets; promoted DouBao Seed to partner status; routing-support badges now surface on provider cards.
- **Role-Based Model Mapping for Claude Code**: Display-name-aware sonnet / opus / haiku route mapping with a `supports1m` flag replaces the legacy `[1M]` suffix and decouples routing from raw model IDs.
- **Codex OAuth Live Model Discovery**: ChatGPT Codex providers now fetch the live model list from the ChatGPT backend on demand instead of relying on a static list.
- **Usage Dashboard Filter-Driven Hero**: A new filter-driven Hero card with cache-normalized totals replaces the legacy summary block, paired with cache-cost-semantics fixes that silence a noisy pricing warning storm.
- **DeepSeek tool-call reasoning and zero-usage final deltas**: DeepSeek tool calls now return `reasoning_content` alongside `tool_calls` (#2543), and the final `message_delta` event always includes a usage block (even when zero) so strict Anthropic clients no longer crash on `null` (#2485).

### Added

- **Claude Desktop Third-Party Provider Switching via Proxy Gateway**: Added a dedicated Claude Desktop surface that brokers third-party Claude providers through CC Switch's in-app proxy, with a routing-support badge for providers that need it, role-based model route mapping locked to `sonnet` / `opus` / `haiku`, Copilot/Codex OAuth provider reuse, a redesigned Claude Code import flow, app-switcher differentiation between "Claude Code" and "Claude Desktop", and 44 provider presets translated from the Claude Code catalog.
- **Routing Support Badges on Provider Cards**: Provider cards in both Claude Code and Codex panels now show a routing-support badge so users can tell at a glance which providers can be served through Local Routing.
- **Codex OAuth Live Model List**: ChatGPT Codex providers now fetch the current model list from the ChatGPT backend on demand, replacing the previously hardcoded selection.
- **Role-Based Model Mapping with 1M Flag**: Claude Code model mapping is now role-based (`sonnet` / `opus` / `haiku`) with display names and a `supports1m` flag, replacing the legacy `[1M]` suffix to decouple routing from raw model IDs.
- **Filter-Driven Usage Hero**: The usage dashboard's Hero summary is now filter-driven with cache-normalized totals so the figures line up with the active date range and provider filters.
- **Provider Form "Save Anyway" Prompt**: Softened provider form validation with a "save anyway" prompt so non-blocking input issues no longer prevent saving (#2307).
- **Universal Provider Duplicate Action**: Added a duplicate action for universal providers from the provider list (#2416).
- **Persisted Tauri Window State**: Window position and size now persist across launches (#2377).
- **Tray Icon Tooltip**: The system tray icon now shows a tooltip on hover for clearer at-a-glance state (#2417).
- **Warp Terminal Session Launch**: Added support for launching Warp and executing a saved session inside it (#2466).
- **DeepSeek `reasoning_content` for Tool Calls**: DeepSeek tool-calling responses now return `reasoning_content` together with `tool_calls` so callers can render both (#2543).
- **Baidu Qianfan Coding Plan for Claude Code**: Added a Baidu Qianfan Coding Plan preset for Claude Code (#2322).
- **Compshare Coding Plan Preset (Cross-App)**: Added Compshare Coding Plan preset across claude / codex / hermes / openclaw.
- **Partner Provider Presets**: Added BytePlus, Volcengine Agentplan, ClaudeAPI, ClaudeCN, RunAPI, RelaxyCode, and PatewayAI provider presets; promoted DouBao Seed to partner status with refreshed endpoint and links.
- **44 Claude Desktop Provider Presets**: Translated 44 provider presets from the Claude Code catalog into the new Claude Desktop surface.

### Changed

- **20 Claude Desktop Presets Switched from Proxy to Direct Mode**: 20 Claude Desktop presets now ship in direct mode instead of routing through the proxy by default, reducing setup friction for users who don't need proxy-specific compatibility shims. Verify connectivity if you previously relied on proxy routing for these presets.
- **Claude Desktop Operational Notes**: Switching a Claude Desktop provider now writes CC Switch's managed 3P profile and requires restarting Claude Desktop to take effect; proxy-mode providers require CC Switch Local Routing to stay running.
- **Failover / Local Routing Guardrails**: Failover controls now require the target app's Local Routing takeover to be enabled, and stopping only the proxy service is blocked while any app still depends on takeover state.
- **Usage Accounting Semantics**: Usage summaries now report cache-normalized real total tokens and cache hit rate; historical token and cost totals may shift after deduplication and pricing recalculation, but should be more accurate.
- **Provider Preset Rendering Order**: Provider preset lists now render in author-defined array order with partners prioritized at the top, replacing the previous implicit sort.
- **Model Mapping Hint Copy Simplified**: `modelMappingOffHint` was rewritten as action-oriented copy across zh / en / ja.
- **CC Switch Brand Surface Unified to ccswitch.io**: All in-app and README references now point at ccswitch.io as the sole official website; the release notes template also surfaces ccswitch.io.
- **Theme Switch Simplified**: Removed the circular reveal animation; theme changes are now an instant cross-fade.
- **Claude Code App Switcher Differentiation**: The app switcher now visually distinguishes "Claude Code" from "Claude Desktop" and uses the "Claude Code" label in the app visibility settings.
- **CI: Claude Review on Opus 4.7**: Upgraded the Claude review GitHub Action to Opus 4.7, tuned the prompt to reduce nitpick noise, added an `@claude` review-only Code Action, pinned PR head SHA for checkout, and dropped a `--max-turns 5` limit.
- **Dependency Bumps**: `actions/checkout` 4 → 6 (#2517), `pnpm/action-setup` 5 → 6 (#2518), `softprops/action-gh-release` 2 → 3 (#2519), `actions/stale` 9 → 10 (#2520).
- **DeepSeek Presets Switched to V4**: DeepSeek presets now ship V4 (flash / pro) with refreshed pricing seeds.
- **Codex 1M Context Toggle Hidden in Provider Edit Form**: The 1M context-window toggle is no longer surfaced in the Codex provider edit form to reduce knob count for a setting that has no effect in current Codex deployments.
- **OpenClaudeCode Migrated to MicuAPI Domain**: Updated the OpenClaudeCode preset to the MicuAPI domain; refreshed Micu API links to `micuapi.ai`.
- **CrazyRouter Endpoints Switched to `cn` Subdomain**: Updated CrazyRouter preset endpoints to the `cn` subdomain.
- **RelaxyCode Custom Icon**: Switched RelaxyCode preset icon to a custom `relaxcode.png` asset.
- **Kimi For Coding Doc URL**: Updated Kimi For Coding website URL to the `/code/docs/` path.
- **SiliconFlow International Site Shows USD**: Balance display now correctly shows USD for the SiliconFlow international site (was incorrectly displaying CNY).

### Fixed

- **OpenAI Responses API Usage Parsing Robustness**: Hardened `build_anthropic_usage_from_responses()` and the Responses → Anthropic SSE translator so a missing or malformed upstream `usage` no longer produces `"usage": null` in `message_delta`. This unblocks strict Anthropic clients (notably the VSCode Claude Code extension) that crashed with "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'output_tokens')" against providers such as Codex OAuth and DashScope's `compatible-mode/v1/responses` endpoint. Added OpenAI field-name fallbacks (`prompt_tokens` / `completion_tokens`), null/empty/partial object handling, and preserved cache token fields even when input/output tokens are missing (#2422).
- **Proxy Reliability Patches (P0–P3)**: Multiple rounds of routing, lifecycle, retry, and rectifier patches across the request-forwarder paths; extracted a shared `handle_rectifier_retry_failure` helper and a shared `auth_header_value` helper across provider adapters.
- **Proxy: Pooled HTTPS Connection Reuse**: Non-Anthropic backends now reuse pooled HTTPS connections instead of opening a fresh TLS session per request, materially reducing per-request latency.
- **Proxy: Forward Client HTTP Method**: The proxy forwards the client's actual HTTP method instead of hard-coding `POST`, so non-POST upstream endpoints (e.g. GET `/v1/models`) work correctly.
- **Proxy: Per-Attempt Counters and `max_retries` Wiring**: Client-request counters moved out of the per-attempt loop, and `AppProxyConfig.max_retries` is now correctly wired into the request forwarder.
- **Proxy: Failover Decision Refinements**: Refined failover decision logic in the forwarder so retryable / unretryable errors are classified more accurately.
- **Proxy: Takeover Detection Tightening**: Tightened takeover detection and use fallback restore when disabling takeover so leftover state no longer strands a provider.
- **Proxy: Anthropic ↔ OpenAI `tool_choice` Mapping**: Anthropic `tool_choice` is now correctly mapped to the OpenAI Chat nested form during format conversion.
- **Proxy: Gemini Request Model Extraction**: Gemini request model is now correctly extracted from the URI path (not the body) so transformed traffic reports the right model.
- **Proxy: Auth Header Error Handling**: `get_auth_headers` now returns `Result` instead of panicking on bad credentials.
- **Proxy: IPv6 Listen Address Validation**: The Proxy panel now accepts IPv6 listen addresses.
- **Proxy: Codex / Responses Cache Hit Rate**: Improved cache hit rate for Codex and OpenAI Responses requests by stabilizing cache key derivation; only emit `prompt_cache_key` when a real client-provided session identity is available so unrelated conversations no longer collapse onto a single key; canonicalize (sort) JSON keys in outgoing request bodies and `tool_call` arguments / `tool_result` content for byte-identical prefix-cache reuse; thread `session_id` into the usage logger for request correlation.
- **Proxy: JSON Schema Underscore Fields Preserved**: Private-parameter filtering now preserves underscore-prefixed field names inside JSON Schema name maps such as `properties`, `patternProperties`, `definitions`, and `$defs`, so user-defined schema keys like `_id` and `_meta` survive the filter.
- **Proxy: Read Tool Empty Pages**: Drop empty pages from `Read` tool inputs so providers don't reject the request (#2472).
- **Proxy: Per-Request Hot-Path Trim**: Trimmed per-request hot-path work and database wait time.
- **Proxy: Real Provider Model Names Under Takeover**: The Claude Code menu now exposes the real provider model names when running under takeover, instead of a stale alias.
- **Proxy: Zero Usage in Final Message Delta**: The final `message_delta` event always includes a usage block (even when zero) so strict Anthropic clients no longer crash on `null` (#2485).
- **Proxy: Streaming `message_delta` Deduplication**: Deduplicated streaming `message_delta` events that some upstreams emit twice (#2366).
- **Proxy: Scoped `reasoning_content` Preserved for Tool Calls**: Tool-call paths now correctly preserve the scoped `reasoning_content` field during transformation; Kimi / Moonshot OpenAI Chat compatibility paths keep the field while generic OpenAI-compatible requests stay free of it (#2367).
- **Proxy: Vertex AI Full URL Preserved**: Full Vertex AI URLs are no longer truncated during proxy forwarding (#2415).
- **Proxy: Leading Billing Header Stripped from System Content**: Strips the leading billing-header content that some upstreams prepend to the system message (#2350).
- **Proxy: Claude Auth Strategy from `ANTHROPIC_*` Env Var**: The Claude auth strategy is now derived from the actual `ANTHROPIC_*` env variable name rather than an opaque heuristic.
- **Third-Party Claude Providers: Disable Model Test**: Model probing is now disabled for third-party Claude providers where the gateway doesn't implement `/v1/models` consistently.
- **Model-Fetch: `/models` Subpath for Anthropic-Compatible Providers**: `/models` discovery now works for Anthropic-compatible subpath providers.
- **Copilot: Claude Model ID Resolution Against Live `/models`**: Copilot-backed providers now resolve Claude model IDs against the live `/models` list to avoid stale ID mismatches.
- **Codex: Skip `environment_context` Injection When Extracting Session Title**: Session title extraction no longer pulls in `environment_context` noise (#2439).
- **Codex: Hide Subagent Sessions**: Codex subagent sessions are now hidden from the main session list (#2445).
- **Codex Startup Live Import Duplication**: Fixed a duplicate-import bug in the Codex startup live-import path (#2590).
- **Codex Provider Switch History Drift**: Switching the active Codex provider no longer changes existing session history (#2349).
- **Codex Usage Log Message**: Corrected a misleading log message for Codex session usage (#2473).
- **Claude: Persist Max Effort via Env**: `max` effort now correctly persists via the env variable on restart (#2493).
- **Claude Desktop: Match Proxy Model Route Without `[1M]` Suffix**: Route matching no longer requires the legacy `[1M]` suffix.
- **Claude Desktop: Provider Form Focus Loss**: Fixed an input that lost focus while editing in the Claude Desktop provider form.
- **Claude Desktop: Spurious Proxy-Stopped Status Alert**: Removed an alert that fired spuriously when the proxy was intentionally stopped.
- **Claude Desktop: Empty Toolbar Capsule Hidden**: Hides the empty toolbar capsule when Claude Desktop is the active app.
- **UI: Monitor Badge Icon Centering**: Centered the Monitor badge icon in the app switcher.
- **Linux: Theme Selection Segfault**: Prevented selecting a theme from causing a segfault on Linux (#2502).
- **Terminal: iTerm Fallback on Cold Launch**: Prevented iTerm from being selected as a fallback on cold launch when not actually present (#2448).
- **Config: Sort JSON Keys Alphabetically**: Config writes now sort JSON keys alphabetically for deterministic output (#2469).
- **Import Existing Side-Effect Free**: Made "import existing" side-effect free (#2429).
- **Coding Plan: Zhipu Weekly Tier by Reset Time**: Corrected the Zhipu weekly tier name to match the actual reset time (#2420).
- **DashScope: Usage Parsing Robustness**: Hardened DashScope usage parsing so a malformed payload no longer crashes the VSCode Claude Code extension (#2425).
- **Usage: Prevent Double-Counting Between Proxy and Session-Log Sources**: Deduplicated usage records sourced from both the proxy and session logs.
- **Usage: Cache Cost Semantics + Pricing Warn Storm**: Corrected cache-cost semantics and silenced a noisy pricing warning storm that fired on every request.
- **CI: Frontend Formatting and Linux Clippy Restored**: Restored frontend formatting and Linux clippy checks in CI.
- **Proxy Test Helper Clippy Warning**: Fixed a clippy warning in the proxy test helper.

### Removed

- **Hermes Agent Usage Tracking Integration**: Removed the in-cycle Hermes Agent usage tracking integration after upstream behavior changes made it impractical to keep in sync. The integration was never enabled in any released version — a zero-cost rendering bug found during its development was fixed before the integration was rolled back.
- **Theme Switch Circular Reveal Animation**: Removed the circular reveal animation used during theme switching; the animation caused jank on slower compositors and added little visible value.
- **DDSHub Partner Integration**: Removed DDSHub as a partner preset and dropped the cross-link blurbs across READMEs.

### Docs

- **README Sponsor Refresh (zh / en / ja)**: Added BytePlus, ClaudeCN, RunAPI, and PatewayAI sponsor entries; cross-linked BytePlus and Volcengine entries; refreshed the Crazyrouter $2 credit claim flow, the Compshare blurb, the Right Code blurb, and other sponsor logos and listings; flattened the LionCC logo onto a white background; switched the Chinese README's sponsor logo to the Volcengine artwork; added Hermes Agent to the README subtitles.
- **Release Notes Template**: Surfaces `ccswitch.io` in the release notes template.
- **Brand Surface**: Documented `ccswitch.io` as the sole official website across READMEs and in-app references.

## [3.14.1] - 2026-04-23

Development since v3.14.0 focuses on Codex OAuth stability, tray usage visibility, Skills import/install reliability, Gemini session restore paths, and simplifying Hermes configuration health handling.

**Stats**: 13 commits | 48 files changed | +1,883 insertions | -808 deletions

### Added

- **Tray Usage Visibility**: System tray submenus now show cached usage for the current Claude / Codex / Gemini provider, including subscription and script-based usage summaries with utilization color markers. Tray-triggered refreshes are throttled, limited to visible apps, and synchronized back into React Query so the main window and tray share fresh usage data (#2184).
- **Tray Coding-Plan Usage (Kimi / Zhipu / MiniMax)**: System tray now renders 5-hour + weekly window usage for Chinese coding-plan providers using the same `🟢 h12% w80%` two-window layout as official subscription badges (worst utilization drives the emoji). Creating a Claude provider whose `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` matches a known coding-plan host now auto-injects `meta.usage_script`, so the tray lights up without opening the Usage Script modal. Existing `usage_script` values are preserved on update.
- **Codex OAuth FAST Mode**: Added an explicit FAST mode toggle for Codex OAuth-backed Claude providers. When enabled, converted Responses requests send `service_tier="priority"` for lower latency; the toggle stays off by default to avoid unexpectedly increasing ChatGPT quota consumption (#2210).

### Changed

- **Session and Settings Layout Polish**: Hardened the scroll-area viewport with width containment to fix horizontal overflow, and tightened app bottom spacing plus settings footer spacing so long session/settings views fit more cleanly (#2201).

### Removed

- **Hermes Config Health Scanner**: Removed the in-app Hermes config health scanner, warning banner, `scan_hermes_config_health` command, `HermesHealthWarning` type, and `HermesWriteOutcome.warnings` payload. CC Switch now keeps the Hermes surface focused on active provider display, provider switching defaults, memory editing, and launching the Hermes Web UI for deep configuration.

### Fixed

- **Codex OAuth Cache Routing**: Stabilized ChatGPT Codex reverse-proxy cache identity by using client-provided session IDs for `prompt_cache_key` and Codex session headers, preserving explicit cache keys, and avoiding generated UUID cache churn (#2218).
- **Codex OAuth Responses SSE Aggregation**: Non-streaming Anthropic clients now receive JSON even when the ChatGPT Codex upstream forces OpenAI Responses SSE; CC Switch aggregates the upstream SSE events before running the non-streaming transform (#2235).
- **Codex OAuth Stream Check Parity**: Stream checks now build Codex OAuth test requests with the same `store: false`, encrypted reasoning include, and provider FAST mode setting as production proxy requests (#2210).
- **Codex Model Extraction**: Replaced first-line regex matching with TOML parsing when reading Codex config models, so multiline TOML is handled correctly (#2227).
- **Model Quick-Set / One-Click Config**: Model quick-set updates now apply against the latest provider form config, preventing stale state from making one-click configuration fail (#2249).
- **Skills Import Duplicates**: The Skills import dialog disables actions while import is pending and the installed-skills cache deduplicates imported results by ID, preventing double-clicks from adding duplicate installed entries (#2139, #2211).
- **Root-Level Skill Repos**: Skill install and update flows now consistently resolve three source patterns: direct nested paths, install-name recursive search, and repository-root `SKILL.md` sources (#2231).
- **Gemini Session Restore Paths**: Gemini session scanning now reads `.project_root` metadata so restore flows can pass the original project directory when available (#2240).
- **Provider Hover Names**: Provider icons now expose the provider name on hover for inline SVG, image URL, and fallback initials render paths (#2237).

## [3.14.0] - 2026-04-21

Development since v3.13.0 focuses on onboarding Hermes Agent as a first-class managed app, rolling out Claude Opus 4.7 across the preset matrix, adding a Gemini Native API proxy, and sharpening session, usage, and proxy workflows.

**Stats**: 100 commits | 219 files changed | +20,548 insertions | -3,569 deletions

### Added

- **Hermes Agent Support (6th Managed App)**: Added Hermes Agent as a first-class managed app with database migration v9→v10, full Rust command surface, YAML-backed `~/.hermes/config.yaml` read/write with atomic backups, MCP sync, Skills sync, session manager with SQLite + JSONL support, and dedicated frontend panels. Supports four API protocols (`chat_completions`, `anthropic_messages`, `codex_responses`, `bedrock_converse`) aligned with Hermes Agent 0.10.0 schema. Read-only rendering for providers owned by the user-authored `providers:` dict, with deep configuration delegated to the Hermes Web UI.
- **Hermes Memory Panel**: Added a Memory panel for editing `MEMORY.md` and `USER.md` directly from CC Switch, with an enable switch, character-count limits, and a live save flow. Replaces the Prompts entry for Hermes.
- **Hermes Provider Presets**: Added ~50 Hermes provider presets spanning Nous Research, Shengsuanyun, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Together AI, StepFun, Zhipu GLM, Bailian, Kimi, MiniMax, DouBao, BaiLing, ModelScope, KAT-Coder, PackyCode, Cubence, AIGoCode, RightCode, AICodeMirror, AICoding, CrazyRouter, SSSAiCode, Micu, CTok.ai, DDSHub, E-FlowCode, LionCCAPI, PIPELLM, Compshare, SiliconFlow, AiHubMix, DMXAPI, TheRouter, Novita, Nvidia, and Xiaomi MiMo.
- **Claude Opus 4.7 Support**: Added Claude Opus 4.7 with adaptive thinking whitelisting, per-million pricing seed, and Bedrock SKU (`anthropic.claude-opus-4-7` / `global.anthropic.claude-opus-4-7`, dropping the legacy `-v1` suffix). Migrated all aggregator and Bedrock presets to Opus 4.7 as the default Opus model.
- **Claude `max` Effort Tier**: Upgraded the Claude effort dropdown from `high` to `max` for extended reasoning capacity.
- **Gemini Native API Proxy**: Added `api_format = "gemini_native"` so the proxy can forward to Google's `generateContent` API with full streaming, schema conversion, and shadow request support. Adds `gemini_url.rs`, `gemini_schema.rs`, `gemini_shadow.rs`, `streaming_gemini.rs`, and `transform_gemini.rs` under the proxy providers module.
- **GitHub Copilot Enterprise Server**: Added GHES authentication and endpoint configuration for Copilot-backed Claude providers, plus thinking-block stripping before upstream to preserve premium interaction quota.
- **Session List Virtualization**: Virtualized the session list via `@tanstack/react-virtual` so long conversations (thousands of records) scroll smoothly; long session messages are now collapsed by default to reduce text layout cost.
- **Codex / OpenClaw Session Title Extraction**: Added meaningful title auto-extraction for Codex and OpenClaw sessions with 2-line display; strips OpenClaw `message_id` suffix noise.
- **Usage Date Range Picker**: Added a date range selector to the usage dashboard with preset tabs (Today / 1d / 7d / 14d / 30d), a custom date + time calendar picker, and a page-jump input on paginated lists.
- **Model Mapping Quick-Set**: Added a quick-set button next to model mapping fields in provider forms for faster edits.
- **Stream Check Error Classification**: Classified Stream Check errors and surfaced them as color-coded toasts; refreshed default probe models and added explicit detection for "model not found" responses.
- **Block Official Provider Switching During Local Routing**: Blocks switching to official providers while Local Routing is active, since routing official API traffic through the local proxy carries account-suspension risk. A warning toast surfaces the block.
- **Pricing Database Refresh (v8 → v9)**: Added ~50 new model pricing entries and corrected stale prices via a reseed-on-migration step, including Claude 4.7, Opus 4.7 Adaptive Thinking, Grok 4, Qwen 3.5/3.6, MiniMax M2.5/M2.7, Doubao Seed 2.0 series, and GLM-5/5.1. DeepSeek and Kimi K2.5 prices updated.
- **Application-Level Window Controls**: Added an opt-in setting to render CC Switch's own minimize / toggle-maximize / close buttons instead of the system decorations, materially improving the experience on Linux Wayland where compositor-drawn buttons can become inert.
- **Hermes in Unified Skills Management**: Added Hermes to the unified Skills surface; skill install, enable, and filter now cover the Hermes app alongside Claude / Codex / Gemini / OpenCode / OpenClaw.
- **OpenClaw Config Directory Override**: Added a settings option to point CC Switch at a custom `openclaw.json` location.
- **Hermes Config Directory Override**: Added a settings option to point CC Switch at a custom `~/.hermes/config.yaml` location, backed by data-driven dispatch.
- **StepFun Step Plan Preset**: Added StepFun Step Plan (EN/ZH) provider presets.
- **New API Usage Script Template**: Added a User-Agent header to the New API usage script template for better upstream compatibility.
- **Launch Hermes Dashboard from Toolbar**: When the Hermes Web UI probe fails, the toolbar entry now offers to run `hermes dashboard` in the user's preferred terminal via a temp bash/batch script. `hermes dashboard` opens the browser itself once ready, so no polling is required. Also corrects the stale `hermes web` hint in the offline toast (the real command is `hermes dashboard`) and reorders Linux terminal detection to try `which` before stat'ing `/usr/bin`, `/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`.
- **LemonData Provider Preset (All Six Apps)**: Registered LemonData as a third-party partner preset across Claude, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, OpenClaw, and Hermes, with icon assets and zh/en/ja partner-promotion copy. Claude uses `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` auth; OpenAI-compatible apps target `gpt-5.4`.
- **DDSHub Codex Preset**: Added a Codex-compatible endpoint for DDSHub at the same host as its Claude service; base URL omits the `/v1` suffix because the gateway auto-routes OpenAI SDK paths.

### Changed

- **"Local Proxy Takeover" → "Local Routing"**: Unified terminology across UI copy, README, and docs in all three locales. Functional behavior is unchanged.
- **Hermes `Auto` api_mode Removed**: Users must now pick an explicit protocol; new deeplinks default to `chat_completions`. Eliminates URL-based heuristic surprises.
- **Hermes Provider Form**: Added an API mode dropdown and per-provider model editor; bound per-provider models to the top-level `model:` when switching active providers.
- **Hermes Deep Config Delegation**: Deep YAML knobs are now delegated to the Hermes Web UI via a direct launch action, rather than duplicated in the CC Switch form.
- **`ANTHROPIC_REASONING_MODEL` Removed from Claude Quick-Set**: Decoupled the reasoning capability from model selection; the legacy field is no longer surfaced in the quick-set form.
- **Per-Provider Proxy Config Removed**: Consolidated into global Local Routing; the provider-level proxy toggle and associated storage are gone.
- **Unified Toolbar Icon Button Width**: Normalized icon-button widths across Claude / Codex / Gemini / OpenCode / OpenClaw / Hermes panels for a consistent header look.
- **Rust Toolchain Pinned to 1.95**: Adopted clippy 1.95 suggestions across the workspace and pinned the toolchain to prevent nightly drift.
- **Tray Menu ID Constant**: The tray identifier moved from the hardcoded string `"main"` to a `TRAY_ID` constant (`"cc-switch"`) across all call sites.
- **Copilot Request Classification**: Refined request routing inside the Copilot optimizer to further reduce unnecessary premium interaction consumption.
- **Usage Script Intranet Support**: Removed private-IP / suspicious-hostname blocking from usage scripts, unblocking enterprise intranet, Docker, and self-hosted API endpoints. Built-in templates still enforce HTTPS (except localhost) and same-origin checks; custom templates remain user-controlled with those request-URL checks skipped.
- **Failover Queue Notes**: Provider notes now appear in failover queue selectors and queue rows for easier identification across multi-provider queues.
- **Hermes Toolbar Layout**: Swapped the Hermes Web UI button from `ExternalLink` to `LayoutDashboard` (clicking may spawn `hermes dashboard` rather than just opening a URL), and moved MCP to the final toolbar slot so Hermes matches the Claude / Codex / Gemini / OpenCode layout.

### Fixed

- **Header Auto-Compact Latching After Maximize**: The toolbar no longer stays compacted after maximize/restore; compaction now reevaluates on size changes.
- **Hermes YAML Pollution & OAuth MCP Auth Drop**: Round-tripping through CC Switch no longer drops OAuth MCP `auth` blocks or pollutes unrelated YAML keys; guard tests added via `tests/hermes_roundtrip.rs`.
- **Hermes Active Provider Display**: Hermes UI now correctly surfaces the active provider and wires add / enable / remove actions.
- **Hermes Provider Persistence**: Providers persist under `custom_providers:` so `api_mode` and `model` survive restarts and config reloads.
- **Codex `cache_control` Preservation**: Preserve `cache_control` when merging system prompts during Codex format conversion (#1946).
- **Claude Prompt Cache Key Leak**: Stopped sending prompt cache keys during Claude chat conversions (#2003).
- **Proxy Hop-by-Hop Header Stripping**: Strip hop-by-hop response headers (Connection, Keep-Alive, Transfer-Encoding, etc.) per RFC 7230.
- **Permissive Proxy CORS Removed**: Removed the permissive CORS layer from the proxy (#1915).
- **Copilot Premium Consumption**: Further reduced unnecessary Copilot premium interaction consumption during pass-through traffic.
- **Backend Error Details in Proxy Toast**: Surface backend error payload details in proxy-related toast messages instead of a generic failure string.
- **Usage Log Deduplication**: Deduplicated proxy and session-log usage records so the same request is no longer double-counted; synced the request log time range with the dashboard's 1d / 7d / 30d selector.
- **Common Config Checkbox Persistence**: Checkbox state for Claude / Codex / Gemini common-config toggles now persists correctly across reopens.
- **Claude Plugin `settings.json` Sync**: Editing the current provider now syncs back to `settings.json` for the Claude plugin path.
- **Google Official Gemini Env Preservation**: Saving the Google Official Gemini provider no longer clobbers the `env` block.
- **OpenCode JSON5 Parser for Trailing Commas**: OpenCode config reads now tolerate trailing commas via a JSON5 parser.
- **Preset Refreshes**: Refreshed stale context windows for DeepSeek and Claude 1M; refreshed stale model IDs; backfilled Hermes model lists; fixed the Nous endpoint and replaced the Hermes placeholder icon with Nous brand artwork; pruned unused official Hermes presets.
- **Auto-Expand Collapsed Messages on Search Hit**: Collapsed messages now auto-expand when a search match lands inside hidden content.
- **Unknown Subscription Quota Tiers Hidden**: Provider cards no longer render unknown subscription quota tiers.
- **Weekly Limit Label Unified**: Aligned the weekly_limit tier label with the official 7-day naming across locales.
- **Root-Level Skill Repo Install**: Fixed skill installation when the repository root itself is a skill.
- **Session ID Parsing Clippy**: Removed a redundant closure in session ID parsing (clippy warning).
- **Usage Log Stat Dedup**: Deduplicated proxy-sourced and session-log-sourced usage records for accurate totals.
- **Stream Check Default Models Refresh**: Updated stream-check default probe models to match each vendor's current lineup.
- **Skills Import Sync**: Imported Skills are now immediately synced into enabled app directories instead of only being recorded in the database, so the UI no longer shows "installed" while the target app directory is missing the skill.
- **Ghostty Session Restore**: Fixed Ghostty session restore launch by using shell execution with `--working-directory`, avoiding `cwd` escaping issues when the path contains spaces or special characters.
- **Hermes Health Check Borrowing OpenClaw Schema**: Hermes providers were routed through `check_additive_app_stream` (the OpenClaw dispatcher), which reads camelCase `baseUrl` / `apiKey` / `api` and surfaced "OpenClaw provider is missing baseUrl" even when every Hermes field was filled. Introduced `check_hermes_stream` with Hermes-specific extractors that map `api_mode` (`chat_completions` / `anthropic_messages` / `codex_responses`) to the matching `check_claude_stream` `api_format`, and returns `bedrock_converse` as unsupported. `api_mode` is now resolved before URL / API key extraction, so `bedrock_converse` users see the real cause rather than a misleading "missing base_url".
- **Usage Query Modal for Hermes & OpenClaw**: `getProviderCredentials` now reads flat `settingsConfig` fields for Hermes (snake_case `base_url` / `api_key`) and OpenClaw (camelCase `baseUrl` / `apiKey`), so the "official balance" template auto-selects for matching providers like SiliconFlow. Also refactored the BALANCE and TOKEN_PLAN test paths to reuse the precomputed `providerCredentials` instead of re-reading `env.ANTHROPIC_*` directly, fixing the "empty key" error for non-Claude apps even when the key was configured.

### Docs

- **README Sponsor Updates**: Updated SiliconFlow signup bonus to ¥16, trimmed the SSSAiCode sponsor blurb, updated partner logos, and added LemonData as a new sponsor.
- **Global Proxy Hint Clarified**: Clarified the global proxy hint about local routing across all three locales.
- **Takeover → Routing Rename**: Renamed takeover docs to routing and updated anchors across all languages.
- **PIPELLM Website URL**: Updated the PIPELLM sponsor website URL to `code.pipellm.ai`.

### Breaking

- **Hermes requires explicit `api_mode`**: The `Auto` mode is gone; imported or deeplinked providers default to `chat_completions`. Users with prior `Auto` configs will be prompted to pick a protocol.
- **`ANTHROPIC_REASONING_MODEL` removed from Claude quick-set**: The legacy field is no longer exposed; existing settings are cleaned up automatically.
- **Per-provider proxy configuration removed**: Migrate to the global Local Routing setting. Existing per-provider proxy values are ignored.
- **Database schema bumped v9 → v10**: Adds `enabled_hermes` columns to `mcp_servers` and `skills` (auto-migrated with `DEFAULT 0`; no data loss).
- **Pricing table reseeded (v8 → v9)**: The `model_pricing` table is cleared and reseeded on first launch to pick up new models and corrected prices.
- **XCodeAPI preset removed**: Users of the XCodeAPI preset should switch to another provider.

## [3.13.0] - 2026-04-10

Development since v3.12.3 focuses on quota visibility, provider workflow upgrades, stronger proxy compatibility, and lower-overhead tray / session workflows.

### Added

- **Lightweight Mode**: Added a tray-only mode that destroys the main window and keeps CC Switch running from the system tray, with the window recreated when users reopen it.
- **Provider Model Auto-Fetch**: Added OpenAI-compatible `/v1/models` discovery for Claude, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, and OpenClaw provider forms, including grouped dropdown selection and failure-specific error messages.
- **Quota & Balance Visibility**: Added inline quota or balance display for official Claude / Codex / Gemini providers, GitHub Copilot premium interactions, Codex OAuth providers, Token Plan providers (Kimi / Zhipu GLM / MiniMax), and official balance queries for DeepSeek, StepFun, SiliconFlow, OpenRouter, and Novita AI. Copilot / ChatGPT OAuth and CLI subscription quota now only auto-poll for the currently active provider, preventing unnecessary API calls and misleading displays on non-current cards.
- **Skills Discovery & Batch Updates**: Added SHA-256 based skill update detection, per-skill and batch update actions, a storage-location toggle between CC Switch and `~/.agents/skills`, and public `skills.sh` search integration.
- **Session Workflow Upgrades**: Added batch delete in Session Manager, a directory picker before launching Claude terminal restore commands, usage import from Claude / Codex / Gemini session logs without requiring proxy interception, and per-app usage filtering for Claude / Codex / Gemini dashboards.
- **Codex OAuth Reverse Proxy**: Added ChatGPT Plus / Pro based Codex OAuth reverse proxy support for Claude provider cards, including managed OAuth login and inline subscription quota display.
- **OpenCode / OpenClaw Stream Check Coverage**: Added OpenCode npm package mapping plus support for OpenClaw `openai-completions` and the remaining OpenClaw protocol variants in Stream Check.
- **Full URL Endpoint Mode**: Added a provider option that treats `base_url` as a complete upstream endpoint so proxy forwarding and stream checks can work with vendors that require nonstandard URL layouts.
- **OpenCode StepFun Step Plan Preset**: Added a StepFun Step Plan provider preset for OpenCode.
- **Copilot Interaction Optimizer**: Added request classification and routing logic to reduce unnecessary GitHub Copilot premium interaction consumption.
- **First-Run Welcome Dialog**: Added a one-time welcome dialog on fresh installs explaining how existing configuration is preserved as a default provider and how the bundled official preset enables one-click revert. Upgrade users are excluded.
- **Official Provider Seeding**: Added automatic seeding of Claude Official, OpenAI Official, and Google Official provider entries on startup, giving every user a one-click path back to the official endpoint.
- **OpenCode / OpenClaw Auto-Import**: Added automatic startup import of live OpenCode and OpenClaw provider configurations, matching the auto-import behavior already present for Claude, Codex, and Gemini.
- **Common Config Editor Guidance**: Added an informational guide and empty-state prompt to the Common Config snippet editor modal for Claude, Codex, and Gemini, with i18n support.
- **Common Config First-Run Notice**: Added a one-time informational dialog explaining Common Config Snippets when users first open the provider add/edit form.
- **Claude Session Titles**: Added meaningful title extraction for Claude sessions using a priority chain: custom-title metadata, first real user message, then directory basename fallback.
- **Session Search Highlighting**: Added keyword highlighting in session titles and messages during Session Manager search.
- **URL-Based Provider Icons**: Added a dual rendering mode to the icon system supporting Vite URL imports for large SVGs and raster images (PNG, JPG, WebP), keeping small SVGs inlined.
- **Kaku Terminal Support**: Added Kaku as a selectable terminal for session launch on macOS, reusing the WezTerm-compatible launch path.
- **OMO Slim Council Support**: Restored first-class council support as a built-in oh-my-opencode-slim agent with updated metadata and UI copy.
- **TheRouter Provider Preset**: Added TheRouter provider presets across Claude, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, and OpenClaw.
- **DDSHub Provider Preset**: Added DDSHub as a third-party partner provider for Claude with icon and partner promotion text.
- **LionCCAPI Provider Preset**: Added LionCCAPI as a third-party partner provider across all five apps with anthropic-messages protocol for OpenCode and OpenClaw.
- **Shengsuanyun Provider Preset**: Added Shengsuanyun (胜算云) as an aggregator partner provider across all five apps with URL-based icon and localized display name.
- **PIPELLM Provider Preset**: Added PIPELLM provider preset across Claude, Codex, OpenCode, and OpenClaw with full model definitions and icon.
- **E-FlowCode Provider Preset**: Added E-FlowCode provider preset across all five apps with per-app protocol configuration.

### Changed

- **Tray Menu Organization**: Reworked the tray menu into per-app submenus to prevent overflow and make background provider switching scale better with larger provider lists.
- **Proxy Forwarding Stack**: Refactored proxy forwarding onto a Hyper-based client with transparent header forwarding, improved endpoint rewriting, and better support for dynamic upstream endpoints.
- **OAuth Auth Center UI Polish**: Tightened the Auth Center copy, layout, and icon presentation so the Codex OAuth login flow feels cleaner and less cluttered.
- **Provider Key Lifecycle & Live Sync**: Reworked additive provider create / rename / duplicate flows so live config writes, cleanup, and rollback stay consistent across OpenCode / OpenClaw and takeover scenarios.
- **Codex OAuth Defaults**: Updated the Codex OAuth preset to the GPT-5.4 model family.

### Fixed

- **Copilot Authentication & Proxy Compatibility**: Fixed GitHub Copilot authentication regressions, corrected enterprise / dynamic endpoint handling, repaired clipboard verification-code copying on macOS and Linux, and fixed Responses routing when Copilot-backed Claude providers target OpenAI models.
- **Streaming Parser Compatibility**: Fixed SSE parsing to accept fields with optional spaces, improving compatibility with non-strict streaming implementations.
- **UTF-8 Stream Chunk Boundaries**: Fixed intermittent garbled output (U+FFFD replacement characters) in Claude Code when multi-byte UTF-8 sequences such as Chinese characters or emoji were split across TCP stream chunks via the Copilot reverse proxy, by preserving incomplete trailing bytes across chunks in all four SSE streaming paths instead of lossy decoding.
- **Fragmented System Prompt Normalization**: Fixed strict OpenAI-compatible chat backends (Nvidia, Qwen-style) rejecting requests when converted Claude payloads contained multiple system messages, by merging system content into a single leading system message during the Anthropic → OpenAI chat transformation.
- **Provider Switch State Corruption**: Serialized per-app provider switches to prevent concurrent failover or hot-switch operations from leaving `is_current`, settings state, and live backup state out of sync.
- **Claude Takeover Live Config Drift**: Fixed provider edits while Claude takeover is active so live settings remain aligned with the latest provider state without breaking takeover restore behavior.
- **WebDAV Password Retention & Validation**: Fixed the WebDAV password field so saved credentials remain visible after refresh and treated `MKCOL 405` responses correctly during connection validation.
- **Provider Card Action States**: Fixed additive-mode highlight behavior, aligned usage display layout across provider cards, replaced hard proxy-switch blocking with a warning path, and disabled unsupported test / usage actions for Copilot and Codex OAuth cards.
- **Usage Accuracy & Pricing**: Fixed MiniMax quota math and 0%→100% progression, corrected CNY→USD pricing plus missing model definitions, improved Gemini session-log syncing, and resolved session-based usage entries being shown as unknown providers.
- **Usage Editor & Skills UI Regressions**: Fixed usage query fields being reset while editing extractor code, corrected broken `skills.sh` links and empty descriptions, and fixed auto-query defaults plus number-input clearing in usage configuration.
- **Chinese Skills Terminology**: Unified Skills-related labels across settings panels in the `zh` locale so storage and sync options use consistent wording.
- **Environment & Preset Compatibility**: Added Bun global bin detection in CLI scan, adapted to the oh-my-openagent rename with backward compatibility, corrected the OpenCode `kimi-for-coding` preset, gated Gemini keychain parsing to macOS, and fixed an OpenClaw serializer panic on empty collections.
- **Linux UI Unresponsive on Startup**: Fixed a bug where the window UI (including native title bar buttons) couldn't receive clicks on Linux until the user manually maximized and restored the window. Root causes: (1) Tauri webview did not acquire keyboard focus after `show()` on Linux, so the first click was consumed by X11/Wayland click-to-activate (Tauri #10746, wry #637); (2) GTK surface's input region failed to renegotiate on the `visible:false → show()` path under some WebKitGTK/compositor combinations, leaving the entire window unresponsive. Mitigations: set `WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE=1` at startup, and added a new `linux_fix::nudge_main_window` helper that performs `set_focus` + a ±1px no-op resize ~200ms after show, equivalent to a visually invisible "maximize-and-restore". Wired into all window-re-show paths (normal startup, deeplink, single_instance, tray `show_main`, lightweight exit).
- **Linux Drag Region on Header**: Removed `data-tauri-drag-region` from the top header bar on Linux to avoid triggering `gtk_window_begin_move_drag` paths affected by Tauri #13440 under Wayland. macOS drag behavior is preserved.
- **OpenCode / OpenClaw Stream Check Edge Cases**: Fixed custom-header passthrough, OpenClaw custom auth-header detection, Bedrock error messaging, and OpenCode default `baseURL` fallback handling in Stream Check.
- **Duplicate Toast on Provider Switch**: Fixed double toast notifications (proxy-required warning followed by switch-success) when switching to Copilot, ChatGPT, or OpenAI-format providers with the proxy not running.
- **Session Search Accuracy & Chinese Support**: Fixed session search result truncation across providers and switched FlexSearch tokenizer to full mode for proper Chinese substring matching.
- **Adaptive Thinking Reasoning Effort**: Fixed `resolve_reasoning_effort()` mapping adaptive thinking to `xhigh` instead of incorrectly using `high` in OpenAI format conversions.
- **Thinking Model Fallback Display**: Fixed the Claude provider form showing an empty Thinking model field after saving only a main model by applying read-only fallback to ANTHROPIC_MODEL.
- **Auth Tab Localization**: Fixed missing i18n translation keys for the settings auth tab label across all locale bundles.
- **Schema Migration Guard**: Fixed database migrations failing when skills or model_pricing tables did not exist by adding table-existence checks before ALTER and UPDATE operations.

### Docs

- **User Manual Refresh**: Updated the EN / ZH / JA manuals for tray submenus, lightweight mode, provider model fetching, session management, workspace files, WebDAV v2 behavior, OpenCode / OpenClaw activation, and other provider workflow improvements.
- **Community & Contribution Docs**: Added `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, bilingual issue / PR templates, Dependabot config, and CI quality checks.
- **Release Notes Risk Notice**: Added a Copilot reverse proxy risk notice and anchored highlight links in the v3.12.3 release notes across all three languages.
- **Sponsor Partners**: Added Shengsuanyun, LionCC, and DDS as sponsor partners in README across all languages.

## [3.12.3] - 2026-03-24

Major release adding GitHub Copilot reverse proxy support, macOS code signing & Apple notarization, intelligent reasoning effort mapping for o-series models, skill backup/restore lifecycle, proxy gzip compression, and critical fixes for WebDAV password safety, tool message parsing, and dark mode.

**Stats**: 36 commits | 107 files changed | +9,124 insertions | -802 deletions

### Added

- **GitHub Copilot Reverse Proxy**: Full GitHub Copilot integration as a Claude Code provider via OAuth Device Code flow; includes multi-account management, automatic token refresh, Anthropic ↔ OpenAI format conversion, real-time model list fetching, and usage statistics (#930)
- **Copilot Auth Center**: New Auth Center panel in Settings for managing GitHub accounts globally, with per-provider account binding via `meta.authBinding`
- **Tool Search Toggle**: Added `ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH` env var support for Claude 2.1.76+; exposed as a checkbox in the provider Common Config editor (#930)
- **Reasoning Effort Mapping**: Two-tier `resolve_reasoning_effort()` for OpenAI o-series and GPT-5+ models — explicit `output_config.effort` takes priority, falling back to thinking `budget_tokens` thresholds (<4 000→low, 4 000–16 000→medium, ≥16 000→high); covers both Chat Completions and Responses API paths with 17 unit tests
- **OpenCode SQLite Backend**: Added SQLite session storage support for OpenCode alongside existing JSON backend; dual-backend scan with SQLite priority on ID conflicts, atomic session deletion, and path validation (#1401)
- **Skill Auto-Backup**: Skill files are automatically backed up to `~/.cc-switch/skill-backups/` before uninstall, with metadata preserved in `meta.json`; old backups pruned to keep at most 20
- **Skill Backup Restore & Delete**: Added list/restore/delete commands for skill backups; restore copies files back to SSOT, saves the DB record, and syncs to the current app with rollback on failure
- **macOS Code Signing & Notarization**: CI now imports an Apple Developer ID certificate, signs the universal binary, submits for Apple notarization, and staples the ticket to both `.app` and `.dmg`; a hard-fail verification step (`codesign --verify` + `spctl -a` + `stapler validate`) gates the release for both artifacts
- **Codex 1M Context Window Toggle**: One-click checkbox in Codex config editor to set `model_context_window = 1000000` with auto-populated `model_auto_compact_token_limit = 900000`; unchecking removes both fields
- **Disable Auto-Upgrade Toggle**: Added `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER` env var checkbox in the Claude Common Config editor to prevent Claude Code from auto-upgrading

### Changed

- **Skills Cache Strategy**: Replaced `invalidateQueries` with direct `setQueryData` updates for skill install/uninstall/import operations; added `staleTime: Infinity` with `keepPreviousData` to eliminate loading flicker (#1573)
- **Proxy Gzip Compression**: Non-streaming proxy requests now auto-negotiate gzip compression instead of forcing `identity`; streaming requests conservatively keep `identity` to avoid SSE decompression errors
- **o1/o3 Model Compatibility**: Chat Completions proxy forwarding now correctly uses `max_completion_tokens` instead of `max_tokens` for OpenAI o-series models such as o1/o3/o4-mini (#1451)
- **OpenCode Model Variants**: Placed OpenCode model variants at top level instead of inside options for better discoverability (#1317)
- **Skills Import Flow**: Replaced implicit filesystem-based app inference with explicit `ImportSkillSelection` to prevent incorrect multi-app activation; added reconciliation to remove disabled/orphaned symlinks and MCP servers from live config
- **Claude 4.6 Context Window**: Updated Claude Opus 4.6 and Sonnet 4.6 context window from 200K to 1M across OpenClaw and OpenCode presets (GA release)
- **MiniMax Model Upgrade**: Updated MiniMax presets from M2.5 to M2.7 across Claude, OpenClaw, and OpenCode configurations with updated partner descriptions in all three locales
- **Xiaomi MiMo Model Upgrade**: Updated MiMo presets from mimo-v2-flash to mimo-v2-pro across all supported applications
- **AddProviderDialog Simplification**: Removed redundant OAuth tab, reducing dialog from 3 tabs to 2 (app-specific + universal)
- **Provider Form Advanced Options Collapse**: Model mapping, API format, and other advanced fields in the Claude provider form now auto-collapse when empty; auto-expands when any value is set or when a preset fills them in

### Fixed

- **WebDAV Password Silent Clear**: Fixed WebDAV password being silently wiped when ProviderList or UsageScriptModal saved settings by stripping `webdavSync` from frontend payloads and adding backend backfill logic in `merge_settings_for_save()` to preserve existing passwords
- **Tool Message Parsing**: Fixed tool_use/tool_result message classification across Claude (tool_result content blocks), Codex (function_call/function_call_output payloads), and Gemini (array content + toolCalls extraction) session providers (#1401)
- **Dark Mode Selector**: Changed Tailwind `darkMode` from `["selector", "class"]` to `["selector", ".dark"]` to ensure correct dark mode activation (#1596)
- **Copilot Request Fingerprint**: Unified Copilot request fingerprint headers across all API call sites to prevent User-Agent leakage and stream check mismatches
- **o-series Responses API Tokens**: Kept Responses API on the correct `max_output_tokens` field for o-series models instead of incorrectly injecting `max_completion_tokens`
- **Provider Form Double Submit**: Prevented duplicate submissions on rapid button clicks in provider add/edit forms (#1352)
- **Ghostty Session Restore**: Fixed Claude session restore in Ghostty terminal (#1506)
- **Skill ZIP Import Extension**: Added `.skill` file extension support in ZIP import dialog (#1240, #1455)
- **Skill ZIP Install Target App**: ZIP skill installs now use the currently active app instead of always defaulting to Claude
- **OpenClaw Active Card Highlight**: Fixed active OpenClaw provider card not being highlighted (#1419)
- **Responsive Layout with TOC**: Improved responsive design when TOC title exists (#1491)
- **Import Skills Dialog White Screen**: Added missing TooltipProvider in ImportSkillsDialog to prevent runtime crash when opening the dialog
- **Panel Bottom Blank Area**: Replaced hardcoded `h-[calc(100vh-8rem)]` with `flex-1 min-h-0` across all content panels to eliminate bottom gap caused by mismatched offset values

### Docs

- **Pricing Model ID Normalization**: Added documentation section explaining model ID normalization rules (prefix stripping, suffix trimming, `@`→`-` replacement) in EN/ZH/JA user manuals (#1591)
- **macOS Signed & Notarized**: Removed all `xattr` workaround instructions and "unidentified developer" warnings from README, README_ZH, installation guides (EN/ZH/JA), and FAQ pages (EN/ZH/JA); replaced with "signed and notarized by Apple" messaging

## [3.12.2] - 2026-03-12

Post-v3.12.1 work focuses on Common Config safety during proxy takeover and more reliable Codex TOML editing.

**Stats**: 5 commits | 22 files changed | +1,716 insertions | -288 deletions

### Added

- **Empty State Guidance**: Improved first-run experience with detailed import instructions and a conditional Common Config snippet hint for Claude/Codex/Gemini providers

### Changed

- **Proxy Takeover Restore Flow**: Proxy takeover hot-switch and provider sync now refresh the restore backup instead of overwriting live config files, rebuilding effective provider settings with Common Config applied so rollback preserves the real user configuration
- **Codex TOML Editing Engine**: Refactored Codex `config.toml` updates onto shared section-aware TOML helpers in Rust and TypeScript, covering `base_url` and `model` field edits across provider forms and takeover cleanup
- **Common Config Initialization Lifecycle**: Startup now auto-extracts Common Config snippets from clean live configs before takeover restoration, tracks explicit "snippet cleared" state, and persists a one-time legacy migration flag to avoid repeated backfills

### Fixed

- **Common Config Loss During Takeover**: Fixed cases where proxy takeover could drop Common Config changes, overwrite live configs during sync, or produce incomplete restore snapshots when switching providers
- **Codex Restore Snapshot Preservation**: Fixed Codex takeover restore backups so existing `mcp_servers` blocks survive provider hot-switches instead of being discarded; changed MCP backup preservation from wholesale table replacement to per-server-id merge so provider/common-config MCP updates win on conflict while live-only servers are retained
- **Cleared Snippet Resurrection**: Fixed startup auto-extraction recreating Common Config snippets that users had intentionally cleared
- **Codex `base_url` Misplacement**: Fixed Codex `base_url` extraction and editing to target the active `[model_providers.<name>]` section instead of appending to the file tail or confusing `mcp_servers.*.base_url` entries for provider endpoints

## [3.11.1] - 2026-02-28

### Hotfix Release

This release reverts the Partial Key-Field Merging architecture introduced in v3.11.0, restoring the proven "full config overwrite + Common Config Snippet" mechanism, and fixes several UI and platform compatibility issues.

**Stats**: 8 commits | 52 files changed | +3,948 insertions | -1,411 deletions

### Reverted

- **Restore Full Config Overwrite + Common Config Snippet** (revert 992dda5c): Reverted the partial key-field merging refactoring from v3.11.0 due to critical issues — non-whitelisted custom fields were lost during provider switching, backfill permanently stripped non-key fields from the database, and the whitelist required constant maintenance. Restores full config snapshot write, Common Config Snippet UI and backend commands, and 6 frontend components/hooks

### Changed

- **Proxy Panel Layout**: Moved proxy on/off toggle from accordion header into panel content area, placed directly above app takeover options, ensuring users see takeover configuration immediately after enabling the proxy
- **Manual Import for OpenCode/OpenClaw**: Removed auto-import on startup; empty state now shows an "Import Current Config" button, consistent with Claude/Codex/Gemini behavior

### Fixed

- **"Follow System" Theme Not Auto-Updating**: Delegated to Tauri's native theme tracking (`set_window_theme(None)`) so the WebView's `prefers-color-scheme` media query stays in sync with OS theme changes
- **Compact Mode Cannot Exit**: Restored `flex-1` on `toolbarRef` so `useAutoCompact`'s exit condition triggers correctly based on available width instead of content width
- **Proxy Takeover Toast Shows {{app}}**: Added missing `app` interpolation parameter to i18next `t()` calls for proxy takeover enabled/disabled messages
- **Windows Protocol Handler Side Effects**: Disabled environment check and one-click install on Windows to prevent unintended protocol handler registration

### Changed

#### Architecture

- **Partial Key-Field Merging (⚠️ Breaking, reverted in v3.11.1)**: Provider switching now uses partial key-field merging instead of full config overwrite, preserving user's non-provider settings (plugins, MCP, permissions). The "Common Config Snippet" feature has been removed as it is no longer needed. Removes 6 frontend files and ~150 lines of backend dead code (#1098)
- **Manual Import**: Replaced auto-import on startup with manual “Import Current Config” button in empty state, reducing ~47 lines of startup code
- **OMO Variant Parameterization**: Eliminated ~250 lines of OMO/OMO Slim code duplication via `OmoVariant` struct with STANDARD/SLIM constants
- **OMO Common Config Removal**: Removed the two-layer merge system for OMO common config (-1,733 lines across 21 files)

#### Code Quality

- **ProviderForm Decomposition**: Extracted ProviderForm.tsx from 2,227 lines to 1,526 lines by splitting into 5 focused modules (opencodeFormUtils, useOmoModelSource, useOpencodeFormState, useOmoDraftState, useOpenclawFormState)
- **Shared MCP/Skills Components**: Extracted AppCountBar, AppToggleGroup, and ListItemRow shared components to eliminate duplication across MCP and Skills panels
- **OpenClaw TanStack Query Migration**: Migrated Env, Tools, and AgentsDefaults panels from manual useState/useEffect to centralized TanStack Query hooks

#### Settings Layout

- **Proxy Tab**: Split Advanced tab into dedicated Proxy tab (local proxy, failover, rectifiers, global outbound proxy); moved pricing config to Usage dashboard as collapsible accordion. SettingsPage reduced from ~716 to ~426 lines with 5-tab layout: General | Proxy | Advanced | Usage | About
- **Data Section Split**: Split data accordion into Import/Export and Cloud Sync sections for better discoverability

#### Terminal & Config

- **Unified Terminal Selection**: Consolidated terminal preference to global settings; added WezTerm support and terminal name mapping (iterm2 → iterm)
- **OpenClaw Agents Panel**: Primary model field set to read-only; detailed model fields (context window, max tokens, reasoning, cost) moved to advanced options
- **Claude Model Update**: Updated Claude model references from 4.5 to 4.6 across all provider presets

### Fixed

#### Critical

- **Windows Home Dir Regression**: Restored default home directory resolution on Windows to prevent providers/settings “disappearing” when `HOME` env var differs from the real user profile directory (Git/MSYS environments); auto-detects v3.10.3 legacy database location
- **Linux White Screen**: Disabled WebKitGTK hardware acceleration on AMD GPUs (Cezanne/Radeon Vega) to prevent EGL initialization failure causing blank screen on startup
- **OpenAI Beta Parameter**: Stopped appending `?beta=true` to OpenAI Chat Completions endpoints, fixing request failures for Nvidia and other `apiFormat=”openai_chat”` providers
- **Health Check Auth Mode**: Health check now respects provider's auth_mode setting instead of always using x-api-key header

#### Provider & Preset

- **OpenClaw /v1 Prefix**: Removed /v1 prefix from OpenClaw anthropic-messages presets to prevent double path (/v1/v1/messages) with Anthropic SDK auto-append
- **Opus Pricing**: Corrected Opus pricing from $15/$75 to $5/$25 and upgraded model ID to claude-opus-4-6
- **AIGoCode URLs**: Unified API base URL to https://api.aigocode.com across all apps; removed trailing /v1 suffix
- **Zhipu GLM**: Removed outdated partner status from Claude, OpenCode, and OpenClaw presets
- **API Key Visibility**: Restored API Key input field when creating new Claude providers (was incorrectly hidden for non-cloud_provider categories)

#### OMO / OMO Slim

- **OMO Slim Category Checks**: Added missing omo-slim category checks across add/form/mutation paths
- **OMO Slim Cache Invalidation**: Invalidate OMO Slim query cache after provider mutations to prevent stale UI state
- **OMO Recommended Models**: Synced agent/category recommended models with upstream sources; fixed provider/model format to pure model IDs
- **OMO Fill Feedback**: Added toast feedback when “Fill Recommended” button silently fails
- **OMO Last-Provider Restriction**: Removed last-provider deletion restriction for OMO/OMO Slim plugins
- **OpenCode Model Validation**: Reject saving OpenCode providers without at least one configured model

#### OpenClaw

- **OpenClaw P0-P3 Fixes**: Fixed 25 missing i18n keys, replaced key={index} with stable crypto.randomUUID(), excluded openclaw from ProxyToggle/FailoverToggle, added deep link merge_additive_config(), unified serde(flatten) naming, added directory existence checks, removed dead code, added duplicate key validation
- **OpenClaw Robustness**: Fixed EnvPanel visibleKeys using entry key names instead of array indices; added NaN guards; validated provider ID and model before import
- **OpenClaw i18n Dedup**: Merged duplicate openclaw i18n keys to restore provider form translations

#### Platform

- **Window Flash**: Prevented window flicker on silent startup (Windows)
- **Title Bar Theme**: Title bar now follows dark/light mode theme changes
- **Skills Path Separator**: Fixed path separator matching for skill installation status on Windows (supports both `/` and `\`)
- **WSL Conditional Compilation**: Added `#[cfg(target_os = “windows”)]` to WSL helper functions to eliminate dead_code warnings on non-Windows platforms

#### UI

- **Toolbar Clipping**: Removed toolbar height limit that was clipping AppSwitcher
- **Update Badge**: Show update badge instead of green check when a newer version is available
- **Session Button Visibility**: Only show Session Manager button for Claude and Codex apps
- **Directory Spacing**: Added vertical spacing between directory setting sections
- **Dark Mode Cards**: Unified SQL import/export card styling in dark mode
- **OpenClaw Scroll**: Enabled scrolling for OpenClaw configuration panel content

#### i18n & Localization

- **Session Manager i18n**: Replaced hardcoded Chinese strings with i18n keys for relative time, role labels, and UI elements
- **OpenClaw Default Model Label**: Renamed “Enable/Default” to “Set as Default / Current Default” with wider button
- **Daily Memory Sort**: Sort daily memory files by filename date (YYYY-MM-DD.md) instead of modification time
- **Backup Name i18n**: Use local time for backup file names

#### Other

- **Skill Doc URL**: Use actual branch from download_repo for documentation URL; switched from /tree/ to /blob/ pointing to SKILL.md
- **OpenCode Install Detection**: Added install.sh priority paths (OPENCODE_INSTALL_DIR > XDG_BIN_DIR > ~/bin > ~/.opencode/bin) with path dedup and cross-platform executable candidates
- **Provider Auto-Import**: Removed auto-import side effect from useProvidersQuery queryFn; users now trigger import manually via empty state button
- **Manual Backup Validation**: Treat missing database file as error during manual backup to prevent false success toast

### Performance

- **Session Panel Loading**: Parallel directory scanning and head-tail JSONL reading for Codex, OpenClaw, and OpenCode session providers
- **Query Cache Cleanup**: Removed unnecessary TanStack Query cache overhead for Tauri local IPC calls

### Documentation

- **Sponsors**: Added/updated SSSAiCode, Crazyrouter, AICoding, Right Code, and MiniMax sponsor entries across all README languages
- **User Manual**: Added user manual documentation (#979)

### Maintenance

- **Phase 4**: Extracted Service layer (`services/{provider,mcp,config,speedtest}.rs`)
- **Phase 5**: Concurrency optimization (`RwLock` instead of `Mutex`, scoped guard to avoid deadlock)

**Frontend Refactoring (React + TypeScript)** - Completed 4-stage refactoring:

- **Stage 1**: Test infrastructure (vitest + MSW + @testing-library/react)
- **Stage 2**: Extracted custom hooks (`useProviderActions`, `useMcpActions`, `useSettings`, `useImportExport`, etc.)
- **Stage 3**: Component splitting and business logic extraction
- **Stage 4**: Code cleanup and formatting unification

**Testing System**:

### 🔄 Migration Notes

For users upgrading from v2.x (Electron version):

- Configuration files remain compatible - no action required
- The app will automatically migrate your existing provider configurations
- Window position and size preferences have been reset to defaults

#### Backup on v1→v2 Migration (cc-switch internal config)

- When the app detects an old v1 config structure at `~/.cc-switch/config.json`, it now creates a timestamped backup before writing the new v2 structure.
- Backup location: `~/.cc-switch/config.v1.backup.<timestamp>.json`
- This only concerns cc-switch's own metadata file; your actual provider files under `~/.claude/` and `~/.codex/` are untouched.

### 🛠️ Development

- Added `pnpm typecheck` command for TypeScript validation
- Added `pnpm format` and `pnpm format:check` for code formatting
- Rust code now uses cargo fmt for consistent formatting
